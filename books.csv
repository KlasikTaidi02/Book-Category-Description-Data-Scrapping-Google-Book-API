Elements of Mathematics,['Gabor Toth'],['Mathematics'],"This textbook offers a rigorous presentation of mathematics before the advent of calculus. Fundamental concepts in algebra, geometry, and number theory are developed from the foundations of set theory along an elementary, inquiry-driven path. Thought-provoking examples and challenging problems inspired by mathematical contests motivate the theory, while frequent historical asides reveal the story of how the ideas were originally developed. Beginning with a thorough treatment of the natural numbers via Peano’s axioms, the opening chapters focus on establishing the natural, integral, rational, and real number systems. Plane geometry is introduced via Birkhoff’s axioms of metric geometry, and chapters on polynomials traverse arithmetical operations, roots, and factoring multivariate expressions. An elementary classification of conics is given, followed by an in-depth study of rational expressions. Exponential, logarithmic, and trigonometric functions complete the picture, driven by inequalities that compare them with polynomial and rational functions. Axioms and limits underpin the treatment throughout, offering not only powerful tools, but insights into non-trivial connections between topics. Elements of Mathematics is ideal for students seeking a deep and engaging mathematical challenge based on elementary tools. Whether enhancing the early undergraduate curriculum for high achievers, or constructing a reflective senior capstone, instructors will find ample material for enquiring mathematics majors. No formal prerequisites are assumed beyond high school algebra, making the book ideal for mathematics circles and competition preparation. Readers who are more advanced in their mathematical studies will appreciate the interleaving of ideas and illuminating historical details."
Mathematical Intuitionism,"[""Al'bert Grigor'evi_ Dragalin""]",['Mathematics'],"In the area of mathematical logic, a great deal of attention is now being devoted to the study of nonclassical logics. This book intends to present the most important methods of proof theory in intuitionistic logic and to acquaint the reader with the principal axiomatic theories based on intuitionistic logic."
Mathematics Education as a Research Domain: A Search for Identity,"['Anna Sierpinska', 'Jeremy Kilpatrick']",['Education'],"No one disputes how important it is, in today's world, to prepare students to un derstand mathematics as well as to use and communicate mathematics in their future lives. That task is very difficult, however. Refocusing curricula on funda mental concepts, producing new teaching materials, and designing teaching units based on 'mathematicians' common sense' (or on logic) have not resulted in a better understanding of mathematics by more students. The failure of such efforts has raised questions suggesting that what was missing at the outset of these proposals, designs, and productions was a more profound knowledge of the phenomena of learning and teaching mathematics in socially established and culturally, politically, and economically justified institutions - namely, schools. Such knowledge cannot be built by mere juxtaposition of theories in disci plines such as psychology, sociology, and mathematics. Psychological theories focus on the individual learner. Theories of sociology of education look at the general laws of curriculum development, the specifics of pedagogic discourse as opposed to scientific discourse in general, the different possible pedagogic rela tions between the teacher and the taught, and other general problems in the inter face between education and society. Mathematics, aside from its theoretical contents, can be looked at from historical and epistemological points of view, clarifying the genetic development of its concepts, methods, and theories. This view can shed some light on the meaning of mathematical concepts and on the difficulties students have in teaching approaches that disregard the genetic development of these concepts."

The Art of Mathematical Problem Solving,['Richard M. Beekman'],['Science'],"Mathematics is a fine art, like painting, sculpture, or music. This book teaches the art of solving challenging mathematics problems. Part I presents a general process for solving problems. Part II contains 35 difficult and challenging mathematics problems with complete solutions. The goal is to teach the reader how to proceed from an initial state of ""panic and fear"" to finding a beautiful and elegant solution to a problem."
Fundamentals of Elementary Mathematics,"['Merlyn J. Behr', 'Dale G. Jungst']",['Mathematics'],"Fundamentals of Elementary Mathematics provides an understanding of the fundamental aspects of elementary mathematics. This book presents the relevance of the mathematical concepts, which are also demonstrated in numerous exercises. Organized into 10 chapters, this book begins with an overview of the study of logic to understand the nature of mathematics. This text then discusses mathematics as a system of structure or as a collection of substructures. Other chapters consider the four essential components in a mathematical or logical system or structure, namely, undefined terms, defined terms, postulates, and theorems. This book discusses as well several principles used in numeration systems and provides examples of some numeration systems that are in use to illustrate these principles. The final chapter deals with the classification of certain mathematical systems as groups, fields, or rings to demonstrate some abstract mathematics. This book is a valuable resource for students and teachers in elementary mathematics."
Distilling Ideas,"['Brian P. Katz', 'Michael Starbird', 'Michael P. Starbird']",['Mathematics'],"Mathematics is not a spectator sport: successful students of mathematics grapple with ideas for themselves. Distilling Ideas presents a carefully designed sequence of exercises and theorem statements that challenge students to create proofs and concepts. As students meet these challenges, they discover strategies of proofs and strategies of thinking beyond mathematics. In order words, Distilling Ideas helps its users to develop the skills, attitudes, and habits of mind of a mathematician and to enjoy the process of distilling and exploring ideas. Distilling Ideas is an ideal textbook for a first proof-based course. The text engages the range of students' preferences and aesthetics through a corresponding variety of interesting mathematical content from graphs, groups, and epsilon-delta calculus. Each topic is accessible to users without a background in abstract mathematics because the concepts arise from asking questions about everyday experience. All the common proof structures emerge as natural solutions to authentic needs. Distilling Ideas or any subset of its chapters is an ideal resource either for an organized Inquiry Based Learning course or for individual study. A student response to Distilling Ideas: ""I feel that I have grown more as a mathematician in this class than in all the other classes I've ever taken throughout my academic life."""
The Mathematics That Power Our World,"['Joseph Khoury', 'Gilles Lamothe']",['Mathematics'],"The Mathematics That Power Our World: How Is It Made? is an attempt to unveil the hidden mathematics behind the functioning of many of the devices we use on a daily basis. For the past years, discussions on the best approach in teaching and learning mathematics have shown how much the world is divided on this issue. The one reality we seem to agree on globally is the fact that our new generation is lacking interest and passion for the subject. One has the impression that the vast majority of young students finishing high school or in their early post-secondary studies are more and more divided into two main groups when it comes to the perception of mathematics. The first group looks at mathematics as a pure academic subject with little connection to the real world. The second group considers mathematics as a set of tools that a computer can be programmed to use and thus, a basic knowledge of the subject is sufficient. This book serves as a middle ground between these two views. Many of the elegant and seemingly theoretical concepts of mathematics are linked to state-of-the-art technologies. The topics of the book are selected carefully to make that link more relevant. They include: digital calculators, basics of data compression and the Huffman coding, the JPEG standard for data compression, the GPS system studied both from the receiver and the satellite ends, image processing and face recognition. This book is a great resource for mathematics educators in high schools, colleges and universities who want to engage their students in advanced readings that go beyond the classroom discussions. It is also a solid foundation for anyone thinking of pursuing a career in science or engineering. All efforts were made so that the exposition of each topic is as clear and self-contained as possible and thus, appealing to anyone trying to broaden his mathematical horizons. Contents: What Makes a Calculator Calculate?Basics of Data Compression, Prefix-Free Codes and Huffman CodesThe JPEG Standard Global Positioning System (GPS)Image Processing and Face Recognition Readership: Advanced high school students, undergraduates and teachers interested in the mathemtics that drive many modern technologies."

Quantitative Reasoning in Mathematics and Science Education,"['Gülseren Karagöz Akar', 'İsmail Özgür Zembat', 'Selahattin Arslan', 'Patrick W. Thompson']",['Education'],"This book focuses on quantitative reasoning as an orienting framework to analyse learning, teaching and curriculum in mathematics and science education. Quantitative reasoning plays a vital role in learning concepts foundational to arithmetic, algebra, calculus, geometry, trigonometry and other ideas in STEM. The book draws upon the importance of quantitative reasoning and its crucial role in education. It particularly delves into quantitative reasoning related to the learning and teaching diverse mathematics and science concepts, conceptual analysis of mathematical and scientific ideas and analysis of school mathematics (K-16) curricula in different contexts. We believe that it can be considered as a reference book to be used by researchers, teacher educators, curriculum developers and pre- and in-service teachers."
Mathematical Methods in Science,['George Pólya'],['Mathematics'],"'Mathematics, taught and learned appropriately, improves the mind and implants good habits of thought.' This tenet underlies all of Professor Pólya's works on teaching and problem-solving. This book captures some of Pólya's excitement and vision. In it he provides enlightenment for all those who have ever wondered how the laws of nature were worked out mathematically. The distinctive feature of the present book is the stress on the history of certain elementary chapters of science; these can be a source of enjoyment and deeper understanding of mathematics even for beginners who have little, or perhaps no, knowledge of physics."

Mathematics For Computation (M4c),"['Marco Benini', 'Olaf Beyersdorff', 'Michael Rathjen', 'Peter Michael Schuster']",['Mathematics'],"The overall topic of the volume, Mathematics for Computation (M4C), is mathematics taking crucially into account the aspect of computation, investigating the interaction of mathematics with computation, bridging the gap between mathematics and computation wherever desirable and possible, and otherwise explaining why not.Recently, abstract mathematics has proved to have more computational content than ever expected. Indeed, the axiomatic method, originally intended to do away with concrete computations, seems to suit surprisingly well the programs-from-proofs paradigm, with abstraction helping not only clarity but also efficiency.Unlike computational mathematics, which rather focusses on objects of computational nature such as algorithms, the scope of M4C generally encompasses all the mathematics, including abstract concepts such as functions. The purpose of M4C actually is a strongly theory-based and therefore, is a more reliable and sustainable approach to actual computation, up to the systematic development of verified software.While M4C is situated within mathematical logic and the related area of theoretical computer science, in principle it involves all branches of mathematics, especially those which prompt computational considerations. In traditional terms, the topics of M4C include proof theory, constructive mathematics, complexity theory, reverse mathematics, type theory, category theory and domain theory.The aim of this volume is to provide a point of reference by presenting up-to-date contributions by some of the most active scholars in each field. A variety of approaches and techniques are represented to give as wide a view as possible and promote cross-fertilization between different styles and traditions."

A History of Mathematics in the United States and Canada,['David E. Zitarelli'],['Mathematics'],"This is the first truly comprehensive and thorough history of the development of mathematics and a mathematical community in the United States and Canada. This first volume of the multi-volume work takes the reader from the European encounters with North America in the fifteenth century up to the emergence of a research community the United States in the last quarter of the nineteenth. In the story of the colonial period, particular emphasis is given to several prominent colonial figures—Jefferson, Franklin, and Rittenhouse—and four important early colleges—Harvard, Québec, William & Mary, and Yale. During the first three-quarters of the nineteenth century, mathematics in North America was largely the occupation of scattered individual pioneers: Bowditch, Farrar, Adrain, B. Peirce. This period is given a fuller treatment here than previously in the literature, including the creation of the first PhD programs and attempts to form organizations and found journals. With the founding of Johns Hopkins in 1876 the American mathematical research community was finally, and firmly, founded. The programs at Hopkins, Chicago, and Clark are detailed as are the influence of major European mathematicians including especially Klein, Hilbert, and Sylvester. Klein's visit to the US and his Evanston Colloquium are extensively detailed. The founding of the American Mathematical Society is thoroughly discussed. David Zitarelli was emeritus Professor of Mathematics at Temple University. A decorated and acclaimed teacher, scholar, and expositor, he was one of the world's leading experts on the development of American mathematics. Author or co-author of over a dozen books, this was his magnum opus—sure to become the leading reference on the topic and essential reading, not just for historians. In clear and compelling prose Zitarelli spins a tale accessible to experts, generalists, and anyone interested in the history of science in North America."
"A Concise Introduction to Pure Mathematics, Third Edition",['Martin Liebeck'],['Mathematics'],"Accessible to all students with a sound background in high school mathematics, A Concise Introduction to Pure Mathematics, Third Edition presents some of the most fundamental and beautiful ideas in pure mathematics. It covers not only standard material but also many interesting topics not usually encountered at this level, such as the theory of solving cubic equations, the use of Euler’s formula to study the five Platonic solids, the use of prime numbers to encode and decode secret information, and the theory of how to compare the sizes of two infinite sets. New to the Third Edition The third edition of this popular text contains three new chapters that provide an introduction to mathematical analysis. These new chapters introduce the ideas of limits of sequences and continuous functions as well as several interesting applications, such as the use of the intermediate value theorem to prove the existence of nth roots. This edition also includes solutions to all of the odd-numbered exercises. By carefully explaining various topics in analysis, geometry, number theory, and combinatorics, this textbook illustrates the power and beauty of basic mathematical concepts. Written in a rigorous yet accessible style, it continues to provide a robust bridge between high school and higher level mathematics, enabling students to study further courses in abstract algebra and analysis."
Mathematical Mindsets,['Jo Boaler'],['Education'],"Banish math anxiety and give students of all ages a clear roadmap to success Mathematical Mindsets provides practical strategies and activities to help teachers and parents show all children, even those who are convinced that they are bad at math, that they can enjoy and succeed in math. Jo Boaler—Stanford researcher, professor of math education, and expert on math learning—has studied why students don't like math and often fail in math classes. She's followed thousands of students through middle and high schools to study how they learn and to find the most effective ways to unleash the math potential in all students. There is a clear gap between what research has shown to work in teaching math and what happens in schools and at home. This book bridges that gap by turning research findings into practical activities and advice. Boaler translates Carol Dweck's concept of 'mindset' into math teaching and parenting strategies, showing how students can go from self-doubt to strong self-confidence, which is so important to math learning. Boaler reveals the steps that must be taken by schools and parents to improve math education for all. Mathematical Mindsets: Explains how the brain processes mathematics learning Reveals how to turn mistakes and struggles into valuable learning experiences Provides examples of rich mathematical activities to replace rote learning Explains ways to give students a positive math mindset Gives examples of how assessment and grading policies need to change to support real understanding Scores of students hate and fear math, so they end up leaving school without an understanding of basic mathematical concepts. Their evasion and departure hinders math-related pathways and STEM career opportunities. Research has shown very clear methods to change this phenomena, but the information has been confined to research journals—until now. Mathematical Mindsets provides a proven, practical roadmap to mathematics success for any student at any age."
Learning How to Teach Mathematical Modeling in School and Teacher Education,['Rita Borromeo Ferri'],['Education'],"This timely resource fills a gap in existing literature on mathematical modeling by presenting both theory- and evidence-based ideas for its teaching and learning. The book outlines four key professional competencies that must be developed in order to effectively and appropriately teach mathematical modeling, and in so doing it seeks to reduce the discrepancies between educational policy and educational research versus everyday teaching practice. Among the key competencies covered are: Theoretical competency for practical work. Task competency for instructional flexibility. Instructional competency for effective and quality lessons. Diagnostic competency for assessment and grading. Learning How to Teach Mathematical Modeling in School and Teacher Education is relevant to practicing and future mathematics teachers at all levels, as well as teacher educators, mathematics education researchers, and undergraduate and graduate mathematics students interested in research based methods for teaching mathematical modeling."
Mathematical Puzzles,['Peter Winkler'],['Mathematics'],"Research in mathematics is much more than solving puzzles, but most people will agree that solving puzzles is not just fun: it helps focus the mind and increases one's armory of techniques for doing mathematics. Mathematical Puzzles makes this connection explicit by isolating important mathematical methods, then using them to solve puzzles and prove a theorem. Features A collection of the world’s best mathematical puzzles Each chapter features a technique for solving mathematical puzzles, examples, and finally a genuine theorem of mathematics that features that technique in its proof Puzzles that are entertaining, mystifying, paradoxical, and satisfying; they are not just exercises or contest problems."

Mathematical Biology,"['Ronald W. Shonkwiler', 'James Herod']",['Science'],"This text presents mathematical biology as a field with a unity of its own, rather than only the intrusion of one science into another. The book focuses on problems of contemporary interest, such as cancer, genetics, and the rapidly growing field of genomics."
Mathematics and Scientific Representation,['Christopher Pincock'],['Philosophy'],"Mathematics plays a central role in much of contemporary science, but philosophers have struggled to understand what this role is or how significant it might be for mathematics and science. In this book Christopher Pincock tackles this perennial question in a new way by asking how mathematics contributes to the success of our best scientific representations. In the first part of the book this question is posed and sharpened using a proposal for how we can determine the content of a scientific representation. Several different sorts of contributions from mathematics are then articulated. Pincock argues that each contribution can be understood as broadly epistemic, so that what mathematics ultimately contributes to science is best connected with our scientific knowledge. In the second part of the book, Pincock critically evaluates alternative approaches to the role of mathematics in science. These include the potential benefits for scientific discovery and scientific explanation. A major focus of this part of the book is the indispensability argument for mathematical platonism. Using the results of part one, Pincock argues that this argument can at best support a weak form of realism about the truth-value of the statements of mathematics. The book concludes with a chapter on pure mathematics and the remaining options for making sense of its interpretation and epistemology. Thoroughly grounded in case studies drawn from scientific practice, this book aims to bring together current debates in both the philosophy of mathematics and the philosophy of science and to demonstrate the philosophical importance of applications of mathematics."
Assessing Mathematical Literacy,"['Kaye Stacey', 'Ross Turner']",['Education'],"This book describes the design, development, delivery and impact of the mathematics assessment for the OECD Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). First, the origins of PISA’s concept of mathematical literacy are discussed, highlighting the underlying themes of mathematics as preparation for life after school and mathematical modelling of the real world, and clarifying PISA’s position within this part of the mathematics education territory. The PISA mathematics framework is introduced as a significant milestone in the development and dissemination of these ideas. The underlying mathematical competencies on which mathematical literacy so strongly depends are described, along with a scheme to use them in item creation and analysis. The development and implementation of the PISA survey and the consequences for the outcomes are thoroughly discussed. Different kinds of items for both paper-based and computer-based PISA surveys are exemplified by many publicly released items along with details of scoring. The novel survey of the opportunity students have had to learn the mathematics promoted through PISA is explained. The book concludes by surveying international impact. It presents viewpoints of mathematics educators on how PISA and its constituent ideas and methods have influenced teaching and learning practices, curriculum arrangements, assessment practices, and the educational debate more generally in fourteen countries."
The Queen of Mathematics,['Jay Goldman'],['Mathematics'],This book takes the unique approach of examining number theory as it emerged in the 17th through 19th centuries. It leads to an understanding of today's research problems on the basis of their historical development. This book is a contribution to cultural history and brings a difficult subject within the reach of the serious reader.
Mathematical Problem Posing,['Lukas Baumanns'],['Mathematics'],"Mathematical problem posing as the substantive formulation of mathematical problems is an activity that lies at the heart of mathematics. In recent years, research in mathematics education has endeavored to gain insights into problem posing—conceptually as well as empirically. In problem-posing research, there has been a focus on analyzing products, that is, the posed problems. Insights into the processes that lead to these products, however, have so far been lacking. Within four journal articles, summarized in this cumulative dissertation, the author attempts to contribute to the understanding of problem-posing processes through conceptual considerations and empirical investigations. The conceptual part consists of a conducted systematic literature review to investigate problem-posing situations and problem-posing activities. The studies in the empirical part deal with the analyses of problem-posing processes of pre-service mathematics teachers from a macroscopic and microscopic perspective. The aim is to develop coherent and meaningful conceptual perspectives for analyzing empirical observations of problem-posing processes."
Ongoing Advancements in Philosophy of Mathematics Education,"['Maria Aparecida Viggiani Bicudo', 'Bronislaw Czarnocha', 'Maurício Rosa', 'Małgorzata Marciniak']",['Education'],"Ongoing Advancements in Philosophy of Mathematics Education approaches the philosophy of mathematics education in a forward movement, analyzing, reflecting, and proposing significant contemporary themes in the field of mathematics education. The theme that gives life to the book is philosophy of mathematics education understood as arising from the intertwining between philosophy of mathematics and philosophy of education which, through constant analytical and reflective work regarding teaching and learning practices in mathematics, is materialized in its own discipline, philosophy of mathematics education. This is the field of investigation of the chapters in the book. The chapters are written by an international cohort of authors, from a variety of countries, regions, and continents. Some of these authors work with philosophical and psychological foundations traditionally accepted by Western civilization. Others expose theoretical foundations based on a new vision and comprising innovative approaches to historical and present-day issues in educational philosophy. The final third of the book is devoted to these unique and innovative research stances towards important and change resistant societal topics such as racism, technology gaps, or the promotion of creativity in the field of mathematics education."

As the most famous work in the history of the physical sciences there is little need to summarize the contents.--J. Norman, 2006."
Native American Mathematics,['Michael P. Closs'],['Mathematics'],"There is no question that native cultures in the New World exhibit many forms of mathematical development. This Native American mathematics can best be described by considering the nature of the concepts found in a variety of individual New World cultures. Unlike modern mathematics in which numbers and concepts are expressed in a universal mathematical notation, the numbers and concepts found in native cultures occur and are expressed in many distinctive ways. Native American Mathematics, edited by Michael P. Closs, is the first book to focus on mathematical development indigenous to the New World. Spanning time from the prehistoric to the present, the thirteen essays in this volume attest to the variety of mathematical development present in the Americas. The data are drawn from cultures as diverse as the Ojibway, the Inuit (Eskimo), and the Nootka in the north; the Chumash of Southern California; the Aztec and the Maya in Mesoamerica; and the Inca and Jibaro of South America. Among the strengths of this collection are this diversity and the multidisciplinary approaches employed to extract different kinds of information. The distinguished contributors include mathematicians, linguists, psychologists, anthropologists, and archaeologists."
The Concept of Stability in Numerical Mathematics,['Wolfgang Hackbusch'],['Mathematics'],"In this book, the author compares the meaning of stability in different subfields of numerical mathematics. Concept of Stability in numerical mathematics opens by examining the stability of finite algorithms. A more precise definition of stability holds for quadrature and interpolation methods, which the following chapters focus on. The discussion then progresses to the numerical treatment of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). While one-step methods for ODEs are always stable, this is not the case for hyperbolic or parabolic differential equations, which are investigated next. The final chapters discuss stability for discretisations of elliptic differential equations and integral equations. In comparison among the subfields we discuss the practical importance of stability and the possible conflict between higher consistency order and stability."

Applied Mathematical Modeling,"['Douglas R. Shier', 'K.T. Wallenius']",['Mathematics'],"The practice of modeling is best learned by those armed with fundamental methodologies and exposed to a wide variety of modeling experience. Ideally, this experience could be obtained by working on actual modeling problems. But time constraints often make this difficult. Applied Mathematical Modeling provides a collection of models illustrating the power and richness of the mathematical sciences in supplying insight into the operation of important real-world systems. It fills a gap within modeling texts, focusing on applications across a broad range of disciplines. The first part of the book discusses the general components of the modeling process and highlights the potential of modeling in practice. These chapters discuss the general components of the modeling process, and the evolutionary nature of successful model building. The second part provides a rich compendium of case studies, each one complete with examples, exercises, and projects. In keeping with the multidimensional nature of the models presented, the chapters in the second part are listed in alphabetical order by the contributor's last name. Unlike most mathematical books, in which you must master the concepts of early chapters to prepare for subsequent material, you may start with any chapter. Begin with cryptology, if that catches your fancy, or go directly to bursty traffic if that is your cup of tea. Applied Mathematical Modeling serves as a handbook of in-depth case studies that span the mathematical sciences, building upon a modest mathematical background. Readers in other applied disciplines will benefit from seeing how selected mathematical modeling philosophies and techniques can be brought to bear on problems in their disciplines. The models address actual situations studied in chemistry, physics, demography, economics, civil engineering, environmental engineering, industrial engineering, telecommunications, and other areas."
Ahmes’ Legacy,['Marcel Danesi'],['Mathematics'],"This book looks at classic puzzles from the perspective of their structures and what they tell us about the brain. It uses the work on the neuroscience of mathematics from Dehaene, Butterworth, Lakoff, Núñez, and many others as a lens to understand the ways in which puzzles reflect imaginative processes blended with rational ones. The book is not about recreational or puzzle-based mathematics in and of itself but rather about what the classic puzzles tell us about the mathematical imagination and its impact on the discipline. It delves into the history of classic math puzzles, deconstructing their raison d’être and describing their psychological features, so that their nature can be fleshed out in order to help understand the mathematical mind. This volume is the first monographic treatment of the psychological nature of puzzles in mathematics. With its user-friendly technical level of discussion, it is of interest to both general readers and those who engage in the disciplines of mathematics, psychology, neuroscience, and/or anthropology. It is also ideal as a textbook source for courses in recreational mathematics, or as reference material in introductory college math courses."
Mathematics of Discrete Structures for Computer Science,['Gordon J. Pace'],['Computers'],"Mathematics plays a key role in computer science, some researchers would consider computers as nothing but the physical embodiment of mathematical systems. And whether you are designing a digital circuit, a computer program or a new programming language, you need mathematics to be able to reason about the design -- its correctness, robustness and dependability. This book covers the foundational mathematics necessary for courses in computer science. The common approach to presenting mathematical concepts and operators is to define them in terms of properties they satisfy, and then based on these definitions develop ways of computing the result of applying the operators and prove them correct. This book is mainly written for computer science students, so here the author takes a different approach: he starts by defining ways of calculating the results of applying the operators and then proves that they satisfy various properties. After justifying his underlying approach the author offers detailed chapters covering propositional logic, predicate calculus, sets, relations, discrete structures, structured types, numbers, and reasoning about programs. The book contains chapter and section summaries, detailed proofs and many end-of-section exercises -- key to the learning process. The book is suitable for undergraduate and graduate students, and although the treatment focuses on areas with frequent applications in computer science, the book is also suitable for students of mathematics and engineering."

"Nets, Puzzles, and Postmen",['Peter M Higgins'],['Mathematics'],"What do road and railway systems, electrical circuits, mingling at parties, mazes, family trees, and the internet all have in common? All are networks - either people or places or things that relate and connect to one another. Only relatively recently have mathematicians begun to explore such networks and connections, and their importance has taken everyone by surprise. The mathematics of networks form the basis of many fascinating puzzles and problems, from tic-tac-toe and circular sudoku to the 'Chinese Postman Problem' (can he deliver all his letters without traversing the same street twice?). Peter Higgins shows how such puzzles as well as many real-world phenomena are underpinned by the same deep mathematical structure. Understanding mathematical networks can give us remarkable new insights into them all."
The Meaning of Proofs,['Gabriele Lolli'],['Mathematics'],"Why mathematics is not merely formulaic: an argument that to write a mathematical proof is tantamount to inventing a story. In The Meaning of Proofs, mathematician Gabriele Lolli argues that to write a mathematical proof is tantamount to inventing a story. Lolli offers not instructions for how to write mathematical proofs, but a philosophical and poetic reflection on mathematical proofs as narrative. Mathematics, imprisoned within its symbols and images, Lolli writes, says nothing if its meaning is not narrated in a story. The minute mathematicians open their mouths to explain something—the meaning of x, how to find y—they are framing a narrative. Every proof is the story of an adventure, writes Lolli, a journey into an unknown land to open a new, connected route; once the road is open, we correct it, expand it. Just as fairy tales offer a narrative structure in which new characters can be inserted into recurring forms of the genre in original ways, in mathematics, each new abstract concept is the protagonist of a different theory supported by the general techniques of mathematical reasoning. In ancient Greece, there was more than an analogy between literature and mathematics, there was direct influence. Euclid’s proofs have roots in poetry and rhetoric. Mathematics, Lolli asserts, is not the mere manipulation of formulas."
Handbook of Cognitive Mathematics,['Marcel Danesi'],['Mathematics'],"Cognitive mathematics provides insights into how mathematics works inside the brain and how it is interconnected with other faculties through so-called blending and other associative processes.

The Making of Mathematics,['Carlo Cellucci'],['Mathematics'],"This book offers an alternative to current philosophy of mathematics: heuristic philosophy of mathematics. In accordance with the heuristic approach, the philosophy of mathematics must concern itself with the making of mathematics and in particular with mathematical discovery. In the past century, mainstream philosophy of mathematics has claimed that the philosophy of mathematics cannot concern itself with the making of mathematics but only with finished mathematics, namely mathematics as presented in published works. On this basis, mainstream philosophy of mathematics has maintained that mathematics is theorem proving by the axiomatic method. This view has turned out to be untenable because of Gödel’s incompleteness theorems, which have shown that the view that mathematics is theorem proving by the axiomatic method does not account for a large number of basic features of mathematics. By using the heuristic approach, this book argues that mathematics is not theorem proving by the axiomatic method, but is rather problem solving by the analytic method. The author argues that this view can account for the main items of the mathematical process, those being: mathematical objects, demonstrations, definitions, diagrams, notations, explanations, applicability, beauty, and the role of mathematical knowledge."

Reactionary Mathematics,['Massimo Mazzotti'],['Mathematics'],"A forgotten episode of mathematical resistance reveals the rise of modern mathematics and its cornerstone, mathematical purity, as political phenomena. The nineteenth century opened with a major shift in European mathematics, and in the Kingdom of Naples, this occurred earlier than elsewhere. Between 1790 and 1830 its leading scientific institutions rejected as untrustworthy the “very modern mathematics” of French analysis and in its place consolidated, legitimated, and put to work a different mathematical culture. The Neapolitan mathematical resistance was a complete reorientation of mathematical practice. Over the unrestricted manipulation and application of algebraic algorithms, Neapolitan mathematicians called for a return to Greek-style geometry and the preeminence of pure mathematics. For all their apparent backwardness, Massimo Mazzotti explains, they were arguing for what would become crucial features of modern mathematics: its voluntary restriction through a new kind of rigor and discipline, and the complete disconnection of mathematical truth from the empirical world—in other words, its purity. The Neapolitans, Mazzotti argues, were reacting to the widespread use of mathematical analysis in social and political arguments: theirs was a reactionary mathematics that aimed to technically refute the revolutionary mathematics of the Jacobins. During the Restoration, the expert groups in the service of the modern administrative state reaffirmed the role of pure mathematics as the foundation of a newly rigorous mathematics, which was now conceived as a neutral tool for modernization. What Mazzotti’s penetrating history shows us in vivid detail is that producing mathematical knowledge was equally about producing certain forms of social, political, and economic order."
Mathematical Control Theory,['Eduardo D. Sontag'],['Science'],"Mathematics is playing an ever more important role in the physical and biologi cal sciences, provoking a blurring of boundaries between scientific disciplines and a resurgence of interest in the modem as well as the classical techniques of applied mathematics. This renewal of interest, both in research and teaching, has led to the establishment of the series Texts in Applied Mathematics (TAM). The development of new courses is a natural consequence of a high level of excitement on the research frontier as newer techniques, such as numerical and symbolic computer systems, dynamical systems, and chaos, mix with and rein force the traditional methods of applied mathematics. Thus, the purpose of this textbook series is to meet the current and future needs of these advances and to encourage the teaching of new courses. TAM will publish textbooks suitable for use in advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate courses, and will complement the Applied Mathematics Sci ences (AMS) series, which will focus on advanced textbooks and research-level monographs. v Preface This textbook introduces the basic concepts and results of mathematical control and system theory. Based on courses that I have taught during the last 15 years, it presents its subject in a self-contained and elementary fashion. It is geared primarily to an audience consisting of mathematically mature advanced undergraduate or beginning graduate students. In addi tion, it can be used by engineering students interested in a rigorous, proof oriented systems course that goes beyond the classical frequency-domain material and more applied courses."
Mathematical Problem Posing,"['Florence Mihaela Singer', 'Nerida F. Ellerton', 'Jinfa Cai']",['Education'],"The mathematics education community continues to contribute research-based ideas for developing and improving problem posing as an inquiry-based instructional strategy for enhancing students’ learning. A large number of studies have been conducted which have covered many research topics and methodological aspects of teaching and learning mathematics through problem posing. The Authors' groundwork has shown that many of these studies predict positive outcomes from implementing problem posing on: student knowledge, problem solving and posing skills, creativity and disposition toward mathematics. This book examines, in-depth, the contribution of a problem posing approach to teaching mathematics and discusses the impact of adopting this approach on the development of theoretical frameworks, teaching practices and research on mathematical problem posing over the last 50 years. ​​"

Mathematical Physics,"['Bruce R. Kusse', 'Erik A. Westwig']",['Science'],"What sets this volume apart from other mathematics texts is its emphasis on mathematical tools commonly used by scientists and engineers to solve real-world problems. Using a unique approach, it covers intermediate and advanced material in a manner appropriate for undergraduate students. Based on author Bruce Kusse's course at the Department of Applied and Engineering Physics at Cornell University, Mathematical Physics begins with essentials such as vector and tensor algebra, curvilinear coordinate systems, complex variables, Fourier series, Fourier and Laplace transforms, differential and integral equations, and solutions to Laplace's equations. The book moves on to explain complex topics that often fall through the cracks in undergraduate programs, including the Dirac delta-function, multivalued complex functions using branch cuts, branch points and Riemann sheets, contravariant and covariant tensors, and an introduction to group theory. This expanded second edition contains a new appendix on the calculus of variation -- a valuable addition to the already superb collection of topics on offer. This is an ideal text for upper-level undergraduates in physics, applied physics, physical chemistry, biophysics, and all areas of engineering. It allows physics professors to prepare students for a wide range of employment in science and engineering and makes an excellent reference for scientists and engineers in industry. Worked out examples appear throughout the book and exercises follow every chapter. Solutions to the odd-numbered exercises are available for lecturers at www.wiley-vch.de/textbooks/."
Mathematical Foundations of Information Retrieval,['S. Dominich'],['Computers'],"This book offers a comprehensive and consistent mathematical approach to information retrieval (IR) without which no implementation is possible, and sheds an entirely new light upon the structure of IR models. It contains the descriptions of all IR models in a unified formal style and language, along with examples for each, thus offering a comprehensive overview of them. The book also creates mathematical foundations and a consistent mathematical theory (including all mathematical results achieved so far) of IR as a stand-alone mathematical discipline, which thus can be read and taught independently. Also, the book contains all necessary mathematical knowledge on which IR relies, to help the reader avoid searching different sources. Audience: The book will be of interest to computer or information scientists, librarians, mathematicians, undergraduate students and researchers whose work involves information retrieval."
Introduction to Mathematical Methods in Bioinformatics,['Alexander Isaev'],['Science'],"This book looks at the mathematical foundations of the models currently in use. All existing books on bioinformatics are software-orientated and they concentrate on computer implementations of mathematical models of biology. This book is unique in the sense that it looks at the mathematical foundations of the models, which are crucial for correct interpretation of the outputs of the models."

Reform in School Mathematics and Authentic Assessment,['Thomas A. Romberg'],['Education'],"Today new ways of thinking about learning call for new ways for monitoring learning. Reform in School Mathematics builds from the vision that assessment can become the bridge for instructional activity, accountability, and teacher development. It places teachers in key roles while developing the theme that we cannot reform the way in which school mathematics is taught without radically reforming the ways the effects of that teaching are monitored. Among others, this volume addresses the issues of the specification of performance standards, the development of authentic tasks, the measure of status and growth or a combination, the development of psychometric models, and the development of scoring rubrics. The new models proposed in this book give teachers a wealth of nontraditional assessment strategies and concrete ways to obtain measures of both group and individual differences in growth."
Art of Mathematics,['Dr. Weihu Hong'],['Mathematics'],"Art of Mathematics by Dr. Weihu Hong Author Dr. Weihu Hong, with his book, Art of Mathematics, has brought us a lot of excitement by showing many methods of constructing surfaces with a lot of examples of imagination, based on different methods of constructing surfaces and their applications. The author created and taught a course on Programming with Mathematica for math major students at Mars Hill University and found that his students enjoyed more math after taking the course. Later, he went into the industry and learned more applications of mathematics. Both teaching and industry working experiences prompted him to write this book. By reading Art of Mathematics, Dr. Hong hopes it will inspire more people to like the subject of mathematics and motivate more students to study the subject with a positive attitude."
Mathematical Literacy on Statistical Measures,['Christian Büscher'],['Education'],"In most countries, only very limited time resources are available for statistics education within mathematics education. Thus, statistics education research needs to develop teaching-learning arrangements that are compact and applicable to classrooms. Christian Büscher designs and investigates a compact teaching-learning arrangement which aims at mathematical and reflective knowledge about statistics. Central results include the specification of the learning content of statistical measures, an empirical reconstruction of students’ learning processes towards statistical measures, and the identification of students’ situated reflections about mathematics within their learning processes."
Discipline and Experience,['Peter Dear'],['Science'],"Although the Scientific Revolution has long been regarded as the beginning of modern science, there has been little consensus about its true character. While the application of mathematics to the study of the natural world has always been recognized as an important factor, the role of experiment has been less clearly understood. Peter Dear investigates the nature of the change that occurred during this period, focusing particular attention on evolving notions of experience and how these developed into the experimental work that is at the center of modern science. He examines seventeenth-century mathematical sciences—astronomy, optics, and mechanics—not as abstract ideas, but as vital enterprises that involved practices related to both experience and experiment. Dear illuminates how mathematicians and natural philosophers of the period—Mersenne, Descartes, Pascal, Barrow, Newton, Boyle, and the Jesuits—used experience in their argumentation, and how and why these approaches changed over the course of a century. Drawing on mathematical texts and works of natural philosophy from all over Europe, he describes a process of change that was gradual, halting, sometimes contradictory—far from the sharp break with intellectual tradition implied by the term ""revolution."""
"Psychology Of Problem Solving, The: The Background To Successful Mathematics Thinking","['Virgadamo Danielle Sauro', 'Posamentier Alfred S', 'Keefe-cooperman Kathleen', 'Kose Gary']",['Mathematics'],"The art or skill of problem solving in mathematics is mostly relegated to the strategies one can use to solve problems in the field. Although this book addresses that issue, it delves deeply into the psychological aspects that affect successful problem-solving. Such topics as decision-making, judgment, and reasoning as well as using memory effectively and a discussion of the thought processes that could help address certain problem-solving situations.Most books that address problem-solving and mathematics focus on the various skills. This book goes beyond that and investigates the psychological aspects to solving problems in mathematics."
Humanizing Mathematics and its Philosophy,['Bharath Sriraman'],['Mathematics'],"This Festschrift contains numerous colorful and eclectic essays from well-known mathematicians, philosophers, logicians, and linguists celebrating the 90th birthday of Reuben Hersh. The essays offer, in part, attempts to answer the following questions set forth by Reuben himself as a focus for this volume: Can practicing mathematicians, as such, contribute anything to the philosophy of math? Can or should philosophers of math, as such, say anything to practicing mathematicians? Twenty or fifty years from now, what will be similar, and what will, or could, or should be altogether different: About the philosophy of math? About math education? About math research institutions? About data processing and scientific computing? The essays also offer glimpses into Reuben’s fertile mind and his lasting influence on the mathematical community, as well as revealing the diverse roots, obstacles and philosophical dispositions that characterize the working lives of mathematicians. With contributions from a veritable “who’s who” list of 20th century luminaries from mathematics and philosophy, as well as from Reuben himself, this volume will appeal to a wide variety of readers from curious undergraduates to prominent mathematicians."
Golden Years of Moscow Mathematics,"['Smilka Zdravkovska', 'Peter L. Duren']",['Mathematics'],"This volume contains articles on the history of Soviet mathematics, many of which are personal accounts by mathematicians who witnessed and contributed to the turbulent and glorious years of Moscow mathematics. The articles in the book focus on mathematical developments in that era, the personal lives of Russian mathematicians, and political events that shaped the course of scientific work in the Soviet Union. Important contributions include an article about Luzin and his school, based in part on documents that were released only after perestroika, and two articles on Kolmogorov. The volume concludes with annotated bibliographies in English and Russian for further reading. The revised edition is appended by an article of Tikhomirov, which provides an update and general overview of 20th-century Moscow mathematics, and it also includes an Index of Names. This book should appeal to mathematicians, historians, and anyone else interested in Soviet mathematical history."
Mathematics Education with Digital Technology,['Adrian Oldknow'],['Education'],"Mathematics Education with Digital Technology examines ways in which widely available digital technologies can be used to benefit the teaching and learning of mathematics. The contributors offer their insights to locate the value of digital technology for mathematics learning within the context of evidence from documented practice, prior research and of educational policy making. Key pedagogical uses of digital technologies are evaluated in relation to effective mathematics learning and practical ideas for teaching and learning mathematics with digital technology are critically analysed. The volume concludes by looking at future developments and by considering the ways in which ICT could be used as a catalyst for cross-curricular work to achieve greater curricular coherence."
Principles Of Applied Mathematics,['James P. Keener'],['Mathematics'],"Principles of Applied Mathematics provides a comprehensive look at how classical methods are used in many fields and contexts. Updated to reflect developments of the last twenty years, it shows how two areas of classical applied mathematics spectral theory of operators and asymptotic analysis are useful for solving a wide range of applied science problems. Topics such as asymptotic expansions, inverse scattering theory, and perturbation methods are combined in a unified way with classical theory of linear operators. Several new topics, including wavelength analysis, multigrid methods, and homogenization theory, are blended into this mix to amplify this theme.This book is ideal as a survey course for graduate students in applied mathematics and theoretically oriented engineering and science students. This most recent edition, for the first time, now includes extensive corrections collated and collected by the author."
Mathematical Topics in Fluid Mechanics: Volume 2: Compressible Models,['Pierre-Louis Lions'],['Language Arts & Disciplines'],"Fluid mechanics models consist of systems of nonlinear partial differential equations for which, despite a long history of important mathematical contributions, no complete mathematical understanding is available. The second volume of this book describes compressible fluid-mechanics models. The book contains entirely new material on a subject known to be rather difficult and important for applications (compressible flows). It is probably a unique effort on the mathematical problems associated with the compressible Navier-Stokes equations, written by one of the world's leading experts on nonlinear partial differential equations. Professor P.L. Lions won the Fields Medal in 1994."

"Mathematical Knowledge, Objects and Applications","['Carl Posy', 'Yemima Ben-Menahem']",['Mathematics'],"This book provides a survey of a number of the major issues in the philosophy of mathematics, such as ontological questions regarding the nature of mathematical objects, epistemic questions about the acquisition of mathematical knowledge, and the intriguing riddle of the applicability of mathematics to the physical world. Some of these issues go back to the nascent years of mathematics itself, others are just beginning to draw the attention of scholars. In addressing these questions, some of the papers in this volume wrestle with them directly, while others use the writings of philosophers such as Hume and Wittgenstein to approach their problems by way of interpretation and critique. The contributors include prominent philosophers of science and mathematics as well as promising younger scholars. The volume seeks to share the concerns of philosophers of mathematics with a wider audience and will be of interest to historians, mathematicians and philosophers alike."
Beyond Constructivism,"['Richard A. Lesh', 'Helen M. Doerr']",['Education'],"This book has two primary goals. On the level of theory development, the book clarifies the nature of an emerging ""models and modeling perspective"" about teaching, learning, and problem solving in mathematics and science education. On the level of emphasizing practical problems, it clarifies the nature of some of the most important elementary-but-powerful mathematical or scientific understandings and abilities that Americans are likely to need as foundations for success in the present and future technology-based information age. Beyond Constructivism: Models and Modeling Perspectives on Mathematics Problem Solving, Learning, and Teaching features an innovative Web site housing online appendices for each chapter, designed to supplement the print chapters with digital resources that include example problems, relevant research tools and video clips, as well as transcripts and other samples of students' work: http://tcct.soe.purdue.edu/booksULandULjournals/modelsULandUL modeling/ This is an essential volume for graduate-level courses in mathematics and science education, cognition and learning, and critical and creative thinking, as well as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in these areas."
Language and Communication in Mathematics Education,"['Judit N. Moschkovich', 'David Wagner', 'Arindam Bose', 'Jackeline Rodrigues Mendes', 'Marcus Schütte']",['Education'],"This book considers some of the outstanding questions regarding language and communication in the teaching and learning of mathematics – an established theme in mathematics education research, which is growing in prominence. Recent research has demonstrated the wide range of theoretical and methodological resources that can contribute to this area of study, including those drawing on cross-disciplinary perspectives influenced by, among others, sociology, psychology, linguistics, and semiotics. Examining language in its broadest sense to include all modes of communication, including visual and gestural as well as spoken and written modes, it features work presented and discussed in the Language and Communication topic study group (TSG 31) at the 13th International Congress on Mathematical Education (ICME-13). A joint session with participants of the Mathematics Education in a Multilingual and Multicultural Environment topic study group (TSG 32) enhanced discussions, which are incorporated in elaborations included in this book. Discussing cross-cutting topics it appeals to readers from a wide range of disciplines, such as mathematics education and research methods in education, multilingualism, applied linguistics and beyond."
Reading and Writing the World with Mathematics,['Eric Gutstein'],['Education'],"Mathematics education in the United States can reproduce social inequalities whether schools use either ""basic-skills"" curricula to prepare mainly low-income students of color for low-skilled service jobs or ""standards-based"" curricula to ready students for knowledge-intensive positions. And working for fundamental social change and rectifying injustice are rarely included in any mathematics curriculum. Reading and Writing the World with Mathematics argues that mathematics education should prepare students to investigate and critique injustice, and to challenge, in words and actions, oppressive structures and acts. Based on teacher-research, the book provides a theoretical framework and practical examples for how mathematics educators can connect schooling to a larger sociopolitical context and concretely teach mathematics for social justice."
Epistemological Foundations of Mathematical Experience,['Leslie P. Steffe'],['Psychology'],"On the 26th, 27th, and 28th of February of 1988, a conference was held on the epistemological foundations of mathematical experience as part of the activities of NSF Grant No. MDR-8550463, Child Generated Multiplying and Dividing Algorithms: A Teaching Experiment. I had just completed work on the book Construction of Arithmetical Meanings and Strategies with Paul Cobb and Ernst von Glasersfeld and felt that substantial progress had been made in understanding the early numerical experiences of the six children who were the subjects of study in that book. While the book was in preparation, I was also engaged in the teaching experiment on mUltiplying and dividing algorithms. My focus in this teaching experiment was on investigating the mathematical experiences of the involved children and on developing a language through which those experiences might be expressed. However, prior to immersing myself in the conceptual analysis of the mathematical experiences of the children, I felt that it was crucial to critically evaluate the progress that we felt we had made in our earlier work. It was toward achieving this goal that I organized the conference. When trying to understand the mathematical experiences of a child, one can do no better than to interact with the child in a mathematical context guided by the intention to specify the child's current knowledge and the progress the child might make."
Fueling Innovation and Discovery,"['National Research Council', 'Division on Engineering and Physical Sciences', 'Board on Mathematical Sciences and Their Applications', 'Committee on the Mathematical Sciences in 2025']",['Mathematics'],"The mathematical sciences are part of everyday life. Modern communication, transportation, science, engineering, technology, medicine, manufacturing, security, and finance all depend on the mathematical sciences. Fueling Innovation and Discovery describes recent advances in the mathematical sciences and advances enabled by mathematical sciences research. It is geared toward general readers who would like to know more about ongoing advances in the mathematical sciences and how these advances are changing our understanding of the world, creating new technologies, and transforming industries. Although the mathematical sciences are pervasive, they are often invoked without an explicit awareness of their presence. Prepared as part of the study on the Mathematical Sciences in 2025, a broad assessment of the current state of the mathematical sciences in the United States, Fueling Innovation and Discovery presents mathematical sciences advances in an engaging way. The report describes the contributions that mathematical sciences research has made to advance our understanding of the universe and the human genome. It also explores how the mathematical sciences are contributing to healthcare and national security, and the importance of mathematical knowledge and training to a range of industries, such as information technology and entertainment. Fueling Innovation and Discovery will be of use to policy makers, researchers, business leaders, students, and others interested in learning more about the deep connections between the mathematical sciences and every other aspect of the modern world. To function well in a technologically advanced society, every educated person should be familiar with multiple aspects of the mathematical sciences."
Mathematical Analysis and Numerical Methods for Science and Technology,"['Robert Dautray', 'Jacques-Louis Lions']",['Mathematics'],"The advent of high-speed computers has made it possible for the first time to calculate values from models accurately and rapidly. Researchers and engineers thus have a crucial means of using numerical results to modify and adapt arguments and experiments along the way. Every facet of technical and industrial activity has been affected by these developments. The objective of the present work is to compile the mathematical knowledge required by researchers in mechanics, physics, engineering, chemistry and other branches of application of mathematics for the theoretical and numerical resolution of physical models on computers. Since the publication in 1924 of the ""Methoden der mathematischen Physik"" by Courant and Hilbert, there has been no other comprehensive and up-to-date publication presenting the mathematical tools needed in applications of mathematics in directly implementable form."
Mathematical Logic,['J.D. Monk'],['Mathematics'],"From the Introduction: ""We shall base our discussion on a set-theoretical foundation like that used in developing analysis, or algebra, or topology. We may consider our task as that of giving a mathematical analysis of the basic concepts of logic and mathematics themselves. Thus we treat mathematical and logical practice as given empirical data and attempt to develop a purely mathematical theory of logic abstracted from these data."" There are 31 chapters in 5 parts and approximately 320 exercises marked by difficulty and whether or not they are necessary for further work in the book."
Five Golden Rules,['John Casti'],['Mathematics'],"In Five Golden Rules, John L. Casti serves as curator to a brilliant collection of 20th-century mathematical theories, leading us on a fascinating journey of discovery and insight. Probing the frontiers of modern mathematics, Casti examines the origins of some of the most important findings of this century. This is a tale of mystery and logic, elegance and reason; it is the story of five monumental mathematical breakthroughs and how they shape our lives. All those intrigued by the mathematical process, nonacademics and professionals alike, will find this an enlightening, eye-opening, and entertaining work. High school algebra or geometry - and enthusiasm - are the only prerequisites. From the theorem that provided the impetus for modern computers to the calculations that sent the first men to the Moon, these breakthroughs have transformed our lives. Casti illustrates each theorem with a dazzling array of real-world problems it has helped solve - how to calculate the shape of space, optimize investment returns, even chart the course of the development of organisms. Along the way, we meet the leading thinkers of the day: John von Neumann, L. E. J. Brouwer, Marston Morse, and Alan Turing, among others. And we come to understand the combination of circumstances that led each to such revolutionary discoveries as the Minimax Theorem, which spawned the exciting field of game theory, and the Simplex Method, which underpins the powerful tools of optimization theory."

N/A,N/A,['Education'],"What is effective mathematics teaching? This book represents the first purposeful cross-cultural collection of studies to answer this question from teachers’ perspectives. It focuses particularly on how teachers view effective teaching of mathematics. Teachers’ voices are heard and celebrated throughout the studies reported in this volume. These studies are drawn from many parts of the world representing both Eastern and Western cultural traditions. The editors and authors have deliberately included the views of teachers and educators from different cultural backgrounds, taking into account that beliefs on effective mathematics teaching and its features are highly influenced by one’s own culture. The book will provide readers and scholars with the stimulus to take the ideas presented and expand on them in ways that help improve mathematics education for children, teachers and researchers in both the East and the West."
Introduction to the Foundations of Applied Mathematics,['Mark H. Holmes'],['Mathematics'],"The objective of this textbook is the construction, analysis, and interpretation of mathematical models to help us understand the world we live in. Rather than follow a case study approach it develops the mathematical and physical ideas that are fundamental in understanding contemporary problems in science and engineering. Science evolves, and this means that the problems of current interest continually change. What does not change as quickly is the approach used to derive the relevant mathematical models, and the methods used to analyze the models. Consequently, this book is written in such a way as to establish the mathematical ideas underlying model development independently of a specific application. This does not mean applications are not considered, they are, and connections with experiment are a staple of this book. The book, as well as the individual chapters, is written in such a way that the material becomes more sophisticated as you progress. This provides some flexibility in how the book is used, allowing consideration for the breadth and depth of the material covered. Moreover, there are a wide spectrum of exercises and detailed illustrations that significantly enrich the material. Students and researchers interested in mathematical modelling in mathematics, physics, engineering and the applied sciences will find this text useful. The material, and topics, have been updated to include recent developments in mathematical modeling. The exercises have also been expanded to include these changes, as well as enhance those from the first edition. Review of first edition: ""The goal of this book is to introduce the mathematical tools needed for analyzing and deriving mathematical models. ... Holmes is able to integrate the theory with application in a very nice way providing an excellent book on applied mathematics. ... One of the best features of the book is the abundant number of exercises found at the end of each chapter. ... I think this is a great book, and I recommend it for scholarly purposes by students, teachers, and researchers."" Joe Latulippe, The Mathematical Association of America, December, 2009"

First Symposium on Artificial Intelligence for Mathematics Education. Book of Abstracts (AI4ME 2020),"['Philippe R. Richard ', 'Steven Van Vaerenbergh ', 'M. Pilar Vélez ']",['Mathematics'],"The digital revolution that we have experienced since the last quarter of the twentieth century has had some influence, yet to be analysed and extended, on the way mathematics is made, taught and learned. While the rate of innovation in these technologies is growing exponentially, the potential impact of most information technologies on mathematical education remains to be fully exploited. In particular, several authoritative voices point out that the technology that will most likely transform education in the coming years is artificial intelligence (AI). Interestingly, today AI is mainly associated with technologies to automate tasks and lower costs, thus serving primarily the interests of the political-administrative, industrial and commercial world. In this scenario, the world of education and, more specifically, didactics, appears at best as a mere user of AI techniques developed in other fields, forgetting that AI should play a much more relevant role here, serving the human being who is doing his work as a mathematician or who is learning mathematics. The AI4ME symposium at the International Centre for Mathematical Meetings (CIEM) in Castro Urdiales is a space for research and reflection to better understand the interconnected challenges of instrumental learning of mathematics and instrumental mathematics, taking advantage of the achievements and opportunities of Artificial Intelligence for Mathematical Education. This book of abstracts gathers the summaries of the talks presented at the symposium, as well as the conclusions of each of the four thematic groups."
Humans-with-Media and the Reorganization of Mathematical Thinking,"['Marcelo C. Borba', 'Monica E. Villarreal']",['Education'],"This book offers a new conceptual framework for reflecting on the role of information and communication technology in mathematics education. Discussion focuses on how computers, writing and oral discourse transform education at an epistemological as well as a political level. Building on examples, research and theory, the authors propose that knowledge is not constructed solely by humans, but by collectives of humans and technologies of intelligence."
Mathematics Education,"['Barbara Allen', 'Sue Johnston-Wilder']",['Education'],"Mathematics Education identifies some of the most significant issues in mathematics education today. Pulling together relevant articles from authors well-known in their fields of study, the book addresses topical issues such as: gender equity attitude teacher belief and knowledge community of practice autonomy and agency assessment technology. The subject is dealt with in three parts: culture of the mathematics classroom, communication in mathematics classrooms and pupils' and teachers' perceptions. Students on postgraduate courses in mathematics education will find this book a valuable resource. Students on BEd and PGCE courses will also find this a useful source of reference as will teachers of mathematics, mentors and advisers."
Mathematical Models for Biological Pattern Formation,"['Philip K. Maini', 'Hans G.

The FRONTIERS volumes are motivated by IMA pro grams and workshops, but are specially planned and written to provide an entree to and assessment of exciting new areas for the application of mathematical tools and analysis. The emphasis in FRONTIERS volumes is on surveys, exposition and outlook, to attract more mathematicians and other scientists to the study of these areas and to focus efforts on the most important issues, rather than papers on the most recent research results aimed at an audience of specialists. The present volume of peer-reviewed papers grew out of the 1998-99 IMA program on ""Mathematics in Biology,"" in particular the Fall 1998 em phasis on ""Theoretical Problems in Developmental Biology and Immunol ogy."" During that period there were two workshops on Pattern Formation and Morphogenesis, organized by Professors Murray, Maini and Othmer. James Murray was one of the principal organizers for the entire year pro gram. I am very grateful to James Murray for providing an introduction, and to Philip Maini and Hans Othmer for their excellent work in planning and preparing this first FRONTIERS volume. I also take this opportunity to thank the National Science Foundation, whose financial support of the IMA made the Mathematics in Biology pro gram possible."

Isaac Newton on Mathematical Certainty and Method,['Niccolo Guicciardini'],['Mathematics'],"An analysis of Newton's mathematical work, from early discoveries to mature reflections, and a discussion of Newton's views on the role and nature of mathematics. Historians of mathematics have devoted considerable attention to Isaac Newton's work on algebra, series, fluxions, quadratures, and geometry. In Isaac Newton on Mathematical Certainty and Method, Niccolò Guicciardini examines a critical aspect of Newton's work that has not been tightly connected to Newton's actual practice: his philosophy of mathematics. Newton aimed to inject certainty into natural philosophy by deploying mathematical reasoning (titling his main work The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy most probably to highlight a stark contrast to Descartes's Principles of Philosophy). To that end he paid concerted attention to method, particularly in relation to the issue of certainty, participating in contemporary debates on the subject and elaborating his own answers. Guicciardini shows how Newton carefully positioned himself against two giants in the “common” and “new” analysis, Descartes and Leibniz. Although his work was in many ways disconnected from the traditions of Greek geometry, Newton portrayed himself as antiquity's legitimate heir, thereby distancing himself from the moderns. Guicciardini reconstructs Newton's own method by extracting it from his concrete practice and not solely by examining his broader statements about such matters. He examines the full range of Newton's works, from his early treatises on series and fluxions to the late writings, which were produced in direct opposition to Leibniz. The complex interactions between Newton's understanding of method and his mathematical work then reveal themselves through Guicciardini's careful analysis of selected examples. Isaac Newton on Mathematical Certainty and Method uncovers what mathematics was for Newton, and what being a mathematician meant to him."
Advances in Mechanics and Mathematics,"['David Yang Gao', 'Raymond W. Ogden']",['Science'],"As any human activity needs goals, mathematical research needs problems -David Hilbert Mechanics is the paradise of mathematical sciences -Leonardo da Vinci Mechanics and mathematics have been complementary partners since Newton's time and the history of science shows much evidence of the ben eficial influence of these disciplines on each other. Driven by increasingly elaborate modern technological applications the symbiotic relationship between mathematics and mechanics is continually growing. However, the increasingly large number of specialist journals has generated a du ality gap between the two partners, and this gap is growing wider. Advances in Mechanics and Mathematics (AMMA) is intended to bridge the gap by providing multi-disciplinary publications which fall into the two following complementary categories: 1. An annual book dedicated to the latest developments in mechanics and mathematics; 2. Monographs, advanced textbooks, handbooks, edited vol umes and selected conference proceedings. The AMMA annual book publishes invited and contributed compre hensive reviews, research and survey articles within the broad area of modern mechanics and applied mathematics. Mechanics is understood here in the most general sense of the word, and is taken to embrace relevant physical and biological phenomena involving electromagnetic, thermal and quantum effects and biomechanics, as well as general dy namical systems. Especially encouraged are articles on mathematical and computational models and methods based on mechanics and their interactions with other fields. All contributions will be reviewed so as to guarantee the highest possible scientific standards."

Mathematical Physics Research at the Cutting Edge,['Charles V. Benton'],['Mathematical physics'],"Physics and mathematics have always been closely intertwined, with developments in one field frequently inspiring the other. Currently, there are many unsolved problems in physics which will likely require innovations in mathematical physics. Mathematical physics is concerned with problems in statistical mechanics, atomic and molecular physics, quantum field theory, and, in general, with the mathematical foundations of theoretical physics. mechanics (both nonrelativistic and relativistic), atomic and molecular physics, the existence and properties of the phases of model ferromagnets, the stability of matter, the theory of symmetry and symmetry breaking in quantum field theory (both in general and in concrete models), and mathematical developments in functional analysis and algebra to which such subjects lead. This book presents leading-edge research in this fast-moving field. Structure of the Kalb-Ramond Gauge Symmetry and Spinor Representations; Group Theoretical Interpretation of CPT-Theorem; Cross Recurrence Plots and Their Applications; Analytical Solutions of the Radiative Transfer Equation in One-dimensional Spherical Geometry With Central Symmetry; Hyperspherical Functions and Harmonic Analysis on the Lorentz Group; The Next Stage: Quantum Game Theory; Index."
"Mindset Mathematics: Visualizing and Investigating Big Ideas, Grade 3","['Jo Boaler', 'Jen Munson', 'Cathy Williams']",['Education'],"Engage students in mathematics using growth mindset techniques The most challenging parts of teaching mathematics are engaging students and helping them understand the connections between mathematics concepts. In this volume, you'll find a collection of low floor, high ceiling tasks that will help you do just that, by looking at the big ideas at the third-grade level through visualization, play, and investigation. During their work with tens of thousands of teachers, authors Jo Boaler, Jen Munson, and Cathy Williams heard the same message—that they want to incorporate more brain science into their math instruction, but they need guidance in the techniques that work best to get across the concepts they needed to teach. So the authors designed Mindset Mathematics around the principle of active student engagement, with tasks that reflect the latest brain science on learning. Open, creative, and visual math tasks have been shown to improve student test scores, and more importantly change their relationship with mathematics and start believing in their own potential. The tasks in Mindset Mathematics reflect the lessons from brain science that: There is no such thing as a math person - anyone can learn mathematics to high levels. Mistakes, struggle and challenge are the most important times for brain growth. Speed is unimportant in mathematics. Mathematics is a visual and beautiful subject, and our brains want to think visually about mathematics. With engaging questions, open-ended tasks, and four-color visuals that will help kids get excited about mathematics, Mindset Mathematics is organized around nine big ideas which emphasize the connections within the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) and can be used with any current curriculum."

"Foundations of Applied Mathematics, Volume 2","['Jeffrey Humpherys', 'Tyler J. Jarvis']",['Mathematics'],"In this second book of what will be a four-volume series, the authors present, in a mathematically rigorous way, the essential foundations of both the theory and practice of algorithms, approximation, and optimization—essential topics in modern applied and computational mathematics. This material is the introductory framework upon which algorithm analysis, optimization, probability, statistics, machine learning, and control theory are built. This text gives a unified treatment of several topics that do not usually appear together: the theory and analysis of algorithms for mathematicians and data science students; probability and its applications; the theory and applications of approximation, including Fourier series, wavelets, and polynomial approximation; and the theory and practice of optimization, including dynamic optimization. When used in concert with the free supplemental lab materials, Foundations of Applied Mathematics, Volume 2: Algorithms, Approximation, Optimization teaches not only the theory but also the computational practice of modern mathematical methods. Exercises and examples build upon each other in a way that continually reinforces previous ideas, allowing students to retain learned concepts while achieving a greater depth. The mathematically rigorous lab content guides students to technical proficiency and answers the age-old question “When am I going to use this?” This textbook is geared toward advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate students in mathematics, data science, and machine learning."

Founding Mathematics on Semantic Conventions,['Casper Storm Hansen'],['Mathematics'],"This book presents a new nominalistic philosophy of mathematics: semantic conventionalism. Its central thesis is that mathematics should be founded on the human ability to create language – and specifically, the ability to institute conventions for the truth conditions of sentences. This philosophical stance leads to an alternative way of practicing mathematics: instead of “building” objects out of sets, a mathematician should introduce new syntactical sentence types, together with their truth conditions, as he or she develops a theory. Semantic conventionalism is justified first through criticism of Cantorian set theory, intuitionism, logicism, and predicativism; then on its own terms; and finally, exemplified by a detailed reconstruction of arithmetic and real analysis. Also included is a simple solution to the liar paradox and the other paradoxes that have traditionally been recognized as semantic. And since it is argued that mathematics is semantics, this solution also applies to Russell’s paradox and the other mathematical paradoxes of self-reference. In addition to philosophers who care about the metaphysics and epistemology of mathematics or the paradoxes of self-reference, this book should appeal to mathematicians interested in alternative approaches."

Becoming a Mathematics Teacher,"['Tony Brown', 'Olwen McNamara']",['Education'],The book is centered on how major curriculum reform shapes mathematics and the professional practices of teachers. This book documents in real time the implementation of a major government numeracy programme and its receipt by trainee and new teachers. It documents the complete life span of that initiative. The account is targeted at an international readership in terms of how curriculum reform more generally shapes mathematics in schools and the practices of teachers. A key dimension of the book is an alternative view of mathematics education research in which the task of teacher development is understood at policy level where large numbers of teachers were interviewed to assess how policies were being processed through individuals. The book provides an easy and accessible commentary utilising contemporary theory to describe how such teachers reconcile their personal aspirations with the external demands they encounter in negotiating their identities as professional teachers.

Opening the Cage,"['Ole Skovsmose', 'Brian Greer']",['Education'],"The picture on the front of this book is an illustration for Totakahini: The tale of the parrot, by Rabindranath Tagore, in which he satirized education as a magnificent golden cage. Opening the cage addresses mathematics education as a complex socio-political phenomenon, exploring the vast terrain that spans critique and politics. Opening the cage includes contributions from educators writing critically about mathematics education in diverse contexts. They demonstrate that mathematics education is politics, they investigate borderland positions, they address the nexus of mathematics, education, and power, and they explore educational possibilities. Mathematics education is not a free enterprise. It is carried on behind bars created by economic, political, and social demands. This cage might not be as magnificent as that in Tagore’s fable. But it is strong. Opening the cage is a critical and political challenge, and we may be surprised to see what emerges."
Computer Graphics and Geometric Modelling,['Max K. Agoston'],['Computers'],"Possibly the most comprehensive overview of computer graphics as seen in the context of geometric modelling, this two volume work covers implementation and theory in a thorough and systematic fashion. Computer Graphics and Geometric Modelling: Mathematics, contains the mathematical background needed for the geometric modeling topics in computer graphics covered in the first volume. This volume begins with material from linear algebra and a discussion of the transformations in affine & projective geometry, followed by topics from advanced calculus & chapters on general topology, combinatorial topology, algebraic topology, differential topology, differential geometry, and finally algebraic geometry. Two important goals throughout were to explain the material thoroughly, and to make it self-contained. This volume by itself would make a good mathematics reference book, in particular for practitioners in the field of geometric modelling. Due to its broad coverage and emphasis on explanation it could be used as a text for introductory mathematics courses on some of the covered topics, such as topology (general, combinatorial, algebraic, and differential) and geometry (differential & algebraic)."

Topics in Physical Mathematics,['Kishore Marathe'],['Mathematics'],"As many readers will know, the 20th century was a time when the fields of mathematics and the sciences were seen as two separate entities. Caused by the rapid growth of the physical sciences and an increasing abstraction in mathematical research, each party, physicists and mathematicians alike, suffered a misconception; not only of the opposition’s theoretical underpinning, but of how the two subjects could be intertwined and effectively utilized. One sub-discipline that played a part in the union of the two subjects is Theoretical Physics. Breaking it down further came the fundamental theories, Relativity and Quantum theory, and later on Yang-Mills theory. Other areas to emerge in this area are those derived from the works of Donaldson, Chern-Simons, Floer-Fukaya, and Seiberg-Witten. Aimed at a wide audience, Physical Topics in Mathematics demonstrates how various physical theories have played a crucial role in the developments of Mathematics and in particular, Geometric Topology. Issues are studied in great detail, and the book steadfastly covers the background of both Mathematics and Theoretical Physics in an effort to bring the reader to a deeper understanding of their interaction. Whilst the world of Theoretical Physics and Mathematics is boundless; it is not the intention of this book to cover its enormity. Instead, it seeks to lead the reader through the world of Physical Mathematics; leaving them with a choice of which realm they wish to visit next."
Art Meets Mathematics in the Fourth Dimension,['Stephen Leon Lipscomb'],['Mathematics'],"To see objects that live in the fourth dimension we humans would need to add a fourth dimension to our three-dimensional vision. An example of such an object that lives in the fourth dimension is a hyper-sphere or “3-sphere.” The quest to imagine the elusive 3-sphere has deep historical roots: medieval poet Dante Alighieri used a 3-sphere to convey his allegorical vision of the Christian afterlife in his Divine Comedy. In 1917, Albert Einstein visualized the universe as a 3-sphere, describing this imagery as “the place where the reader’s imagination boggles. Nobody can imagine this thing.” Over time, however, understanding of the concept of a dimension evolved. By 2003, a researcher had successfully rendered into human vision the structure of a 4-web (think of an ever increasingly-dense spider’s web). In this text, Stephen Lipscomb takes his innovative dimension theory research a step further, using the 4-web to reveal a new partial image of a 3-sphere. Illustrations support the reader’s understanding of the mathematics behind this process. Lipscomb describes a computer program that can produce partial images of a 3-sphere and suggests methods of discerning other fourth-dimensional objects that may serve as the basis for future artwork."

Connecting Mathematics and Mathematics Education,['Erich Christian Wittmann'],['Education'],"This Open Access book features a selection of articles written by Erich Ch. Wittmann between 1984 to 2019, which shows how the “design science conception” has been continuously developed over a number of decades. The articles not only describe this conception in general terms, but also demonstrate various substantial learning environments that serve as typical examples. In terms of teacher education, the book provides clear information on how to combine (well-understood) mathematics and methods courses to benefit of teachers. The role of mathematics in mathematics education is often explicitly and implicitly reduced to the delivery of subject matter that then has to be selected and made palpable for students using methods imported from psychology, sociology, educational research and related disciplines. While these fields have made significant contributions to mathematics education in recent decades, it cannot be ignored that mathematics itself, if well understood, provides essential knowledge for teaching mathematics beyond the pure delivery of subject matter. For this purpose, mathematics has to be conceived of as an organism that is deeply rooted in elementary operations of the human mind, which can be seamlessly developed to higher and higher levels so that the full richness of problems of various degrees of difficulty, and different means of representation, problem-solving strategies, and forms of proof can be used in ways that are appropriate for the respective level. This view of mathematics is essential for designing learning environments and curricula, for conducting empirical studies on truly mathematical processes and also for implementing the findings of mathematics education in teacher education, where it is crucial to take systemic constraints into account."

Neurodynamics,"['Stephen Coombes', 'Kyle C. A. Wedgwood']",['Mathematics'],"This book is about the dynamics of neural systems and should be suitable for those with a background in mathematics, physics, or engineering who want to see how their knowledge and skill sets can be applied in a neurobiological context. No prior knowledge of neuroscience is assumed, nor is advanced understanding of all aspects of applied mathematics! Rather, models and methods are introduced in the context of a typical neural phenomenon and a narrative developed that will allow the reader to test their understanding by tackling a set of mathematical problems at the end of each chapter. The emphasis is on mathematical- as opposed to computational-neuroscience, though stresses calculation above theorem and proof. The book presents necessary mathematical material in a digestible and compact form when required for specific topics. The book has nine chapters, progressing from the cell to the tissue, and an extensive set of references. It includes Markov chain models for ions, differential equations for single neuron models, idealised phenomenological models, phase oscillator networks, spiking networks, and integro-differential equations for large scale brain activity, with delays and stochasticity thrown in for good measure. One common methodological element that arises throughout the book is the use of techniques from nonsmooth dynamical systems to form tractable models and make explicit progress in calculating solutions for rhythmic neural behaviour, synchrony, waves, patterns, and their stability. This book was written for those with an interest in applied mathematics seeking to expand their horizons to cover the dynamics of neural systems. It is suitable for a Masters level course or for postgraduate researchers starting in the field of mathematical neuroscience."

Invitation to Mathematics,['Konrad Jacobs'],['Mathematics'],"Based on a well-received course designed for philosophy students, this book is an informal introduction to mathematical thinking. The work will be rewarding not only for philosophers concerned with mathematical questions but also for serious amateur mathematicians with an interest in the ""frontiers"" as well as the foundations of mathematics. In what might be termed a sampler of the discipline, Konrad Jacobs discusses an unusually wide range of topics, including such items of contemporary interest as knot theory, optimization theory, and dynamical systems. Using Euclidean geometry and algebra to introduce the mathematical mode of thought, the author then turns to recent developments. In the process he offers what he calls a ""Smithsonian of mathematical showpieces"": the five Platonic Solids, the Mbius Strip, the Cantor Discontinuum, the Peano Curve, Reidemeister's Knot Table, the plane ornaments, Alexander's Horned Sphere, and Antoine's Necklace. The treatments of geometry and algebra are followed by a chapter on induction and one on optimization, game theory, and mathematical economics. The chapter on topology includes a discussion of topological spaces and continuous mappings, curves and knots, Euler's polyhedral formula for surfaces, and the fundamental group. The last chapter deals with dynamics and contains material on the Game of Life, circle rotation, Smale's ""horseshoe,"" and stability and instability, among other topics."

The book includes mathematical descriptions of epidemiological concepts, and uses classic epidemic models to introduce different mathematical methods in model analysis. Matlab codes are also included for numerical implementations. It is primarily written for upper undergraduate and beginning graduate students in mathematical sciences who have an interest in mathematical modeling of infectious diseases. Although written in a rigorous mathematical manner, the style is not unfriendly to non-mathematicians."
Analysis of Some Mathematical Models of Cell Dynamics in Hematology,['Lorand Gabriel Parajdi '],['Computers'],"Bringing new contributions to science might be challenging, however, this is our path to evolution. We cannot assume that we know everything, but it is only our curiosity that can lead us to answers. Therefore, we can and we should keep trying, seeking new and different paths. There is always a starting point: asking yourself „Why?”, and the answer will follow… The purpose of the present book is the study of some mathematical models of cell dynamics and convex optimization problems applied to chronic myeloid leukemia, a type of leukemia also known as chronic myelogenous leukemia. We take into consideration basic concepts, methods and results from the theory of differential equations, such as: existence, uniqueness, monotonicity, boundedness, continuous dependence on data and stability of solutions."
Mathematical Thinking,"['Masami Isoda', 'Shigeo Katagiri']",['Mathematics'],"Developing mathematical thinking is one of major aims of mathematics education. In mathematics education research, there are a number of researches which describe what it is and how we can observe in experimental research. However, teachers have difficulties developing it in the classrooms. This book is the result of lesson studies over the past 50 years. It describes three perspectives of mathematical thinking: Mathematical Attitude (Minds set), Mathematical Methods in General and Mathematical Ideas with Content and explains how to develop them in the classroom with illuminating examples."

The Didactics of Mathematics: Approaches and Issues,"['Bernard R Hodgson', 'Alain Kuzniak', 'Jean-Baptiste Lagrange']",['Education'],"This book, the outcome of a conference organised in 2012 in Paris as a homage to Michèle Artigue, is based on the main component of this event. However, it offers more than a mere reflection of the conference in itself, as various well-known researchers from the field have been invited to summarize the main topics where the importance of Artigue’s contribution is unquestionable. Her multiple interest areas, as a researcher involved in a wider community, give to this volume its unique flavour of diversity. Michèle Artigue (ICMI 2013 Felix Klein Award, CIAEM 2015 Luis Santaló Award) is without doubt one of the most influential researchers nowadays in the field of didactics of mathematics. This influence rests both on the quality of her research and on her constant contribution, since the early 1970s, to the development of the teaching and learning of mathematics. Observing her exemplary professional history, one can witness the emergence, the development, and the main issues of didactics of mathematics as a specific research field."
Eastern European Mathematics Education in the Decades of Change,['Alexander Karp'],['Education'],"This contributed volume is devoted to the recent history and evolution of mathematics education in Eastern Europe, exploring how it was influenced by social and political changes in this part of the world. Despite the broad recognition of the importance of these changes, little scholarship exists that examines the ways in which they were followed by changes in the teaching of mathematics in the post-socialist countries. Indeed, the analyzed processes are complex and vary across the states. Accordingly, this book touches on many factors--including differences in cultures and traditions – that find expression in the teaching of mathematics. Specifically, this volume seeks to explore what changes there were in education in general and in the position of mathematics in school education in these years, and how these changes may be explained and documented; what changes there were in the content of mathematics education and its assessment, and how were they motivated and adopted; what new textbooks appeared and what new methodological ideas were offered in them; how and why mathematics teacher education and/or professional development changed; what was the role (if any) of foreign influences on mathematics education, etc.The book will be of interest to both researchers in mathematics education and practitioners-teachers, as well as a broader audience of historians and educators exploring the political aspects of education."
The Mathematics of Life,['Ian Stewart'],['Science'],"Biologists have long dismissed mathematics as being unable to meaningfully contribute to our understanding of living beings. Within the past ten years, however, mathematicians have proven that they hold the key to unlocking the mysteries of our world -- and ourselves. In The Mathematics of Life, Ian Stewart provides a fascinating overview of the vital but little-recognized role mathematics has played in pulling back the curtain on the hidden complexities of the natural world -- and how its contribution will be even more vital in the years ahead. In his characteristically clear and entertaining fashion, Stewart explains how mathematicians and biologists have come to work together on some of the most difficult scientific problems that the human race has ever tackled, including the nature and origin of life itself."

The Amazing Beginnings of Mathematics,"['Robert Natanek', 'Calvin J. Irons']",N/A,"How often do you use mathematics in your everyday life? You may set an alarm to wake up at a certain time, you may go for a run for a certain amount of distance, you might use a map powered by GPS coordinates to know how to get somewhere, and you may give yourself a certain amount of time get to your destination on time. We all use mathematics without thinking about it, and that has always been the case since the early human civilisations. Throughout history humans have been capable of sophisticated mathematical thinking to live, strive and survive, and many of the mathematical concepts invented by our early ancestors have evolved and are still used today. Did you know the binary number system used to power our digital technology was first employed in the Indus Valley over 4,000 years ago? Or that navigation systems like GPS use the mathematical concept of degrees that the Babylonians of Mesopotamia first began to use over 3,000 years ago. This book, The Amazing Beginnings of Mathematics explores the earliest origins of mathematics and their connections to the mathematics we use today. Whether you have a deep interest in mathematics and history or are someone who simply wonders, the engaging presentation and activities in this book will help you understand and appreciate the significant role of early civilisations in developing the concepts that underpin modern advances in mathematics. Also important to note that this book explores the non-European beginnings of mathematics - it is rare to find a mathematics history book that explores the contributions of the Aztec and Maya civilisation of Mesoamerica or the Inca of South America which this book does. Often mathematics is seen as confusing, intimidating, or exclusive to 'gifted' individuals. However, the authors Calvin and Robert believe that everyone can do well in mathematics with the right learning approach using interesting materials. This book features over 60 activity pages that have been woven throughout the discussion and designed to be accessible to a wide audience, usually beginning with students in the primary grades. These activities will teach you to multiply like an ancient Egyptian or work out the area of a field just like the Aztecs did!"

The African Mother Tongue and Mathematical Ideas,['Abdul Karim Bangura'],['Education'],"This book by renowned scholar Dr Abdul Karim Bangura combines linguistics and mathematics to show how and why African-centred mathematical ideas can be a driving force in Africa’s development efforts. Bangura explores the concept that Africa has been the centre of the History of Mathematics for thousands of years, as the civilizations that emerged across the continent developed contributions which would enrich both ancient and modern understanding of nature through mathematics. However, scholars and other professionals working in the field of mathematics education in Africa have identified a plethora of issues in carrying out their tasks. This is highlighted by one of the most compelling arguments in the book, which is that a major reason for these problems is the fact that the African mother tongues has been greatly neglected in the teaching of mathematics in the continent. Bangura asserts that a change has to be made in order for Africa to benefit from the exceptional opportunities mathematics offer, showing that, even if there is a great body of work connecting linguistics and mathematics, few analyses have been performed on the link between African languages and mathematics—and the ones that have been made are not theoretically-grounded on linguistics. Thus, the book begins by identifying the objects of study of linguistics and mathematics, and delineates which ones they have in common. Next, since the object of study of linguistics is language, the nine design features of language are employed to examine each of the objects as it pertains to African languages. After that, mathematical ideas of sustainability and those of tipping points are suggested as means to help Africa’s development efforts."

Classical Mathematics from Al-Khwarizmi to Descartes,['Roshdi Rashed'],['History'],"This book follows the development of classical mathematics and the relation between work done in the Arab and Islamic worlds and that undertaken by the likes of Descartes and Fermat. ‘Early modern,’ mathematics is a term widely used to refer to the mathematics which developed in the West during the sixteenth and seventeenth century. For many historians and philosophers this is the watershed which marks a radical departure from ‘classical mathematics,’ to more modern mathematics; heralding the arrival of algebra, geometrical algebra, and the mathematics of the continuous. In this book, Roshdi Rashed demonstrates that ‘early modern,’ mathematics is actually far more composite than previously assumed, with each branch having different traceable origins which span the millennium. Going back to the beginning of these parts, the aim of this book is to identify the concepts and practices of key figures in their development, thereby presenting a fuller reality of these mathematics. This book will be of interest to students and scholars specialising in Islamic science and mathematics, as well as to those with an interest in the more general history of science and mathematics and the transmission of ideas and culture."
Number Theory,['W.A. Coppel'],['Mathematics'],"Undergraduate courses in mathematics are commonly of two types. On the one hand are courses in subjects - such as linear algebra or real analysis - with which it is considered that every student of mathematics should be acquainted. On the other hand are courses given by lecturers in their own areas of specialization, which are intended to serve as a preparation for research. But after taking courses of only these two types, students might not perceive the sometimes surprising interrelationships and analogies between different branches of mathematics, and students who do not go on to become professional mathematicians might never gain a clear understanding of the nature and extent of mathematics. The two-volume Number Theory: An Introduction to Mathematics attempts to provide such an understanding of the nature and extent of mathematics. It is a modern introduction to the theory of numbers, emphasizing its connections with other branches of mathematics. Part A, which should be accessible to a first-year undergraduate, deals with elementary number theory. Part B is more advanced than the first and should give the reader some idea of the scope of mathematics today. The connecting theme is the theory of numbers. By exploring its many connections with other branches, we may obtain a broad picture."

Mathematics Education in Africa,"['Brantina Chirinda', 'Kakoma Luneta', 'Alphonse Uworwabayeho']",['Education'],"This book is about mathematics teaching and learning in Africa during the Fourth Industrial Revolution. The Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) has evolved to utilize new technologies in the teaching and learning of Mathematics. It is characterized by the fusion of the biological, physical and digital worlds and embodies a new era of innovation in mathematics education, leading to the rapid emergence of new technologies for mathematics teaching and learning. Because 4IR in mathematics education is happening differently in various parts of Africa, the authors of the various chapters in this volume have positioned their work in their respective local contexts. The chapters address a wide variety of interests, concerns, and implications regarding 4IR and Mathematics Education in Africa. Additionally, a number of chapters address teaching mathematics in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic that has gripped the world. Other chapters discuss the implications of inequalities in Africa that effect mathematics education during 4IR. Chapters also incorporate arguments, observations, and suggestions to, improve and transform the teaching and learning of mathematics in Africa during the 4IR. This book highlights a new era of innovation in mathematics education in the context of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, leading to the rapid emergence of new technologies in mathematics teaching and learning. It is a valuable resource for graduate students, people with research interests in the fourth industrial revolution and mathematics educators at any level, including all mathematics teachers; mathematics education curriculum designers and policymakers."
Mathematical Enculturation,['Alan Bishop'],['Education'],"Mathematics is in the unenviable position of being simultaneously one of the most important school subjects for today's children to study and one of the least well understood. Its reputation is awe-inspiring. Everybody knows how important it is and everybody knows that they have to study it. But few people feel comfortable with it; so much so that it is socially quite acceptable in many countries to confess ignorance about it, to brag about one's incompe tence at doing it, and even to claim that one is mathophobic! So are teachers around the world being apparently legal sadists by inflicting mental pain on their charges? Or is it that their pupils are all masochists, enjoying the thrill of self-inflicted mental torture? More seriously, do we really know what the reasons are for the mathematical activity which goes on in schools? Do we really have confidence in our criteria for judging what's important and what isn't? Do we really know what we should be doing? These basic questions become even more important when considered in the context of two growing problem areas. The first is a concern felt in many countries about the direction which mathematics education should take in the face of the increasing presence of computers and calculator-related technol ogy in society."

MATHEON,['Peter Deuflhard'],['Electronic books'],"Mathematics: intellectual endeavor, production factor, key technology, key to key technologies? Mathematics is all of these! The last three of its facets have been the focus of the research and development in the Berlin-based DFG Research Center MATHEON in the last twelve years. Through these activities MATHEON has become an international trademark for carrying out creative, application-driven research in mathematics and for cooperating with industrial partners in the solution of complex problems in key technologies. Modern key technologies have become highly sophisticated, integrating aspects of engineering, computer, business and other sciences. Flexible mathematical models, as well as fast and accurate methods for numerical simulation and optimization open new possibilities to handle the indicated complexities, to react quickly, and to explore new options. Researchers in mathematical fields such as Optimization, Discrete Mathematics, Numerical Analysis, Scientific Computing, Applied Analysis and Stochastic Analysis have to work hand in hand with scientists and engineers to fully exploit this potential and to strengthen the transversal role of mathematics in the solution of the challenging problems in key technologies. This book presents in seven chapters the highlights of the research work carried out in the MATHEON application areas: Life Sciences, Networks, Production, Electronic and Photonic Devices, Finance, Visualization, and Education. The chapters summarize many of the contributions, put them in the context of current mathematical research activities and outline their impact in various key technologies. To make some of the results more easily accessible to the general public, a large number of ""showcases"" are presented that illustrate a few success stories."
The Earnest Contemplation of Trivial Pursuits,"['Jennifer Beineke', 'Associate Professor of Mathematics Jason Rosenhouse']",N/A,"The history of mathematics is filled with major breakthroughs resulting from solutions to recreational problems. Problems of interest to gamblers led to the modern theory of probability, for example, and surreal numbers were inspired by the game of Go. Yet even with such groundbreaking findings and a wealth of popular-level books exploring puzzles and brainteasers, research in recreational mathematics has often been neglected. The Mathematics of Various Entertaining Subjects brings together authors from a variety of specialties to present fascinating problems and solutions in recreational mathematics. Contributors to the book show how sophisticated mathematics can help construct mazes that look like famous people, how the analysis of crossword puzzles has much in common with understanding epidemics, and how the theory of electrical circuits is useful in understanding the classic Towers of Hanoi puzzle. The card game SET is related to the theory of error-correcting codes, and simple tic-tac-toe takes on a new life when played on an affine plane. Inspirations for the book's wealth of problems include board games, card tricks, fake coins, flexagons, pencil puzzles, poker, and so much more. Looking at a plethora of eclectic games and puzzles, The Mathematics of Various Entertaining Subjects is sure to entertain, challenge, and inspire academic mathematicians and avid math enthusiasts alike."
Numeracy and Mathematics Across the Primary Curriculum,"['David Coles', 'Tim Copeland']",['Education'],"The key to good primary teaching of numeracy and mathematics is confidence in mathematical knowledge and its relevance to the real world.

Multilingualism in Mathematics Education in Africa,['Anthony A. Essien'],['Education'],"This book brings together the first book collection of African research in mathematics education in multilingual societies and chronicles current research in different linguistic contexts across the African continent, (including Algeria, Namibia, Malawi, Morocco, Rwanda, South Africa) on issues of multilingualism in mathematics education, but more importantly, it foregrounds pertinent issues for future research. With many of the authors building on earlier path-breaking African research, the book is a unique contribution of careful thinking through how linguistic diversity and multilingualism manifest in ways that differ from one geopolitical context to another. This volume is an important contribution to the growing recognition of multilingualism as the global 'linguistic dispensation' in mathematics education. It is an invitation to how we might (as an international community where more and more multilingualism is the norm rather than an exception) pay more attention to the multilingual agency and capabilities of both students and teachers in order to better harness the epistemic potential of multiple languages in contexts of language diversity in mathematics education."

The Mathematical Olympiad Handbook,['Anthony Gardiner'],['Juvenile Nonfiction'],Olympiad problems help able school students flex their mathematical muscles. Good Olympiad problems are unpredictable: this makes them worthwhile but it also makes them seem hard and even unapproachable. The Mathematical Olympiad Handbook contains some of the problems and solutions from the British Mathematical Olympiads from 1965 to 1996 in a form designed to help bright students overcome this barrier.
Encyclopaedia of Mathematics,['Michiel Hazewinkel'],['Mathematics'],"This ENCYCLOPAEDIA OF MATHEMATICS aims to be a reference work for all parts of mathe matics. It is a translation with updates and editorial comments of the Soviet Mathematical Encyclopaedia published by 'Soviet Encyclopaedia Publishing House' in five volumes in 1977-1985. The annotated translation consists of ten volumes including a special index volume. There are three kinds of articles in this ENCYCLOPAEDIA. First of all there are survey-type articles dealing with the various main directions in mathematics (where a rather fine subdivi sion has been used). The main requirement for these articles has been that they should give a reasonably complete up-to-date account of the current state of affairs in these areas and that they should be maximally accessible. On the whole, these articles should be understandable to mathematics students in their first specialization years, to graduates from other mathematical areas and, depending on the specific subject, to specialists in other domains of science, en gineers and teachers of mathematics. These articles treat their material at a fairly general level and aim to give an idea of the kind of problems, techniques and concepts involved in the area in question. They also contain background and motivation rather than precise statements of precise theorems with detailed definitions and technical details on how to carry out proofs and constructions. The second kind of article, of medium length, contains more detailed concrete problems, results and techniques."

The Future of Post-Human Mathematical Logic,['Peter Baofu'],['Medical'],"Why should mathematical logic be grounded on the basis of some formal requirements in the way that it has been developed since its classical emergence as a hybrid field of mathematics and logic in the 19th century or earlier? Contrary to conventional wisdom, the foundation of mathematic logic has been grounded on some false (or dogmatic) assumptions which have much impoverished the pursuit of knowledge. This is not to say that mathematical logic has been useless. Quite on the contrary, it has been quite influential in shaping the way that reality is to be understood in numerous fields of knowledge—by learning from the mathematical study of logic and its reverse, the logical study of mathematics. In the final analysis, the future of mathematical logic will depend on how its foundational crisis is to be resolved, and ""the contrastive theory of rationality"" (in this book) is to precisely show how and why it can be done by taking a contrastive turn, subject to the constraints imposed upon by ""existential dialectic principles"" at the ontological level (to avoid any reductionistic fallacy) and other ones (like the perspectives of culture, society, nature, and the mind). The contrastive theory of rationality thus shows a better way to ground mathematical logic (beyond both classical and non-classical logics) for the future advancement of knowledge and, if true, will alter the way of how mathematical logic is to be understood, with its enormous implications for the future of knowledge and its ""post-human"" fate."
Mathematical Cognition and Understanding,"['Katherine M. Robinson', 'Adam K. Dubé', 'Donna Kotsopoulos']",['Education'],"This book focuses on elementary and middle school children’s understanding of mathematics as well as the cognitive aspects involved in the development of mathematical knowledge, skills, and understanding. Children’s success in and understanding of mathematics stem from factors beyond the mathematics curriculum. Researchers are increasingly becoming aware of the necessity to consider a complex set of variables when accounting for large individual differences in mathematics achievement. These chapters contribute to how both researchers and educators can consider the multidimensionality of skills involved in developing mathematical knowledge in the middle school years as well as to how this knowledge can be used to enhance practices in the mathematics classroom. Topics include the cognitive and spatial skills involved in mathematics knowledge, the role of motivation in mathematics learning, the neurological processes and development of children’s mathematics skills, the development of understanding of arithmetic and fraction concepts, the factors relating to children’s word problem success, and techniques to promote mathematics understanding. This book and its companion, Mathematical Teaching and Learning, take an interdisciplinary perspective to mathematical learning and development in the elementary and middle school years. The authors and perspectives in this book draw from education, neuroscience, developmental psychology, and cognitive psychology. The book will be relevant to scholars/educators in the field of mathematics education and also those in childhood development and cognition. Each chapter also includes practical tips and implications for parents as well as for educators and researchers."
Using Mobile Technologies in the Teaching and Learning of Mathematics,"['Nigel Calder', 'Kevin Larkin', 'Nathalie Sinclair']",['Education'],"Mobile technologies influence the way that we interact with the world, the way that we live. We use them for communication, entertainment, information and research. In education settings, there has been substantial investment in mobile devices, often without a concomitant investment in developing pedagogy and practices. With mobile technologies evolving rapidly, and the number of educational apps growing, there is a need for research into how they facilitate mathematics learning. Such research is of particular importance regarding how such devices may be used to open up new ways of envisaging mathematics and mathematics education, and to help develop conceptual rather than procedural or declarative knowledge. This volume draws upon international research and reports on a range of research projects that have incorporated mobile technologies for mathematics education. It presents research on the use of mobile technologies, such as iPads, iPods, iPhones, Androids, and Tablets, across a diverse range of cultures, year levels and contexts. It examines the ways in which mobile technologies, including apps, might influence students’ engagement, cognition, collaboration and attitudes, through the reshaping of the learning experience. In addition, the book presents appropriate ways to integrate mobile technologies into teaching and learning programmes. It is a significant reference book for those involved with teaching mathematics or using mobile technologies in education, while also offering insights and examples that are applicable to the use of digital technologies in education generally."

Vedic Mathematics for Schools,['James T. Glover'],['Juvenile Nonfiction'],"Vedic Mathematics for Schools, Book 2 is intended as a first year textbook for senior schools or for children aiming for examination at 11+. It is based on the fundamental principles of Vedic mathematics which were reconstructed earlier this century by Sri Sankaracarya Bharati Krsna Tirthaji. Although the sutras may well be very ancient, practice and experience have shown that they are highly relevant and useful to the modern-day teaching of mathematics. They are entirely applicable to modern problems and even to modern approaches to mathematics. Topics covered include the four rules of number, fractions and decimals, simplifying and solving in algebra, perimeters and areas, ratio and proportion, percentages, averages, graphs, angles and basic geometrical constructions. The book contains step-by-step worked examples with explanatory notes together with over two hundred practice exercises. The material in this book is currently used at schools around the world assocaited with the Education Renaissance Trust."

Mathematics Learning in Early Childhood,"['National Research Council', 'Division of Behavioral and Social Sciences and Education', 'Center for Education', 'Committee on Early Childhood Mathematics']",['Education'],"Early childhood mathematics is vitally important for young children's present and future educational success. Research demonstrates that virtually all young children have the capability to learn and become competent in mathematics. Furthermore, young children enjoy their early informal experiences with mathematics. Unfortunately, many children's potential in mathematics is not fully realized, especially those children who are economically disadvantaged. This is due, in part, to a lack of opportunities to learn mathematics in early childhood settings or through everyday experiences in the home and in their communities. Improvements in early childhood mathematics education can provide young children with the foundation for school success. Relying on a comprehensive review of the research, Mathematics Learning in Early Childhood lays out the critical areas that should be the focus of young children's early mathematics education, explores the extent to which they are currently being incorporated in early childhood settings, and identifies the changes needed to improve the quality of mathematics experiences for young children. This book serves as a call to action to improve the state of early childhood mathematics. It will be especially useful for policy makers and practitioners-those who work directly with children and their families in shaping the policies that affect the education of young children."
The Professional Education and Development of Teachers of Mathematics,"['Ruhama Even', 'Deborah Loewenberg Ball']",['Education'],"The premise of the 15th ICMI Study is that teachers are key to students' opportunities to learn mathematics. What teachers of mathematics know, care about, and do is a product of their experiences and socialization, together with the impact of their professional education. The Professional Education and Development of Teachers of Mathematics assembles important new international work- development, research, theory and practice - concerning the professional education of teachers of mathematics. As it examines critical areas to reveal what is known and what significant questions and problems warrant collective attention, the volume also contributes to the strengthening of the international community of mathematics educators. The Professional Education and Development of Teachers of Mathematics is of interest to the mathematics education community as well as to other researchers, practitioners and policy makers concerned with the professional education of teachers."
Classics in the History of Greek Mathematics,['Jean Christianidis'],['Mathematics'],"The twentieth century is the period during which the history of Greek mathematics reached its greatest acme. Indeed, it is by no means exaggerated to say that Greek mathematics represents the unique field from the wider domain of the general history of science which was included in the research agenda of so many and so distinguished scholars, from so varied scientific communities (historians of science, historians of philosophy, mathematicians, philologists, philosophers of science, archeologists etc. ), while new scholarship of the highest quality continues to be produced. This volume includes 19 classic papers on the history of Greek mathematics that were published during the entire 20th century and affected significantly the state of the art of this field. It is divided into six self-contained sections, each one with its own editor, who had the responsibility for the selection of the papers that are republished in the section, and who wrote the introduction of the section. It constitutes a kind of a Reader book which is today, one century after the first publications of Tannery, Zeuthen, Heath and the other outstanding figures of the end of the 19th and the beg- ning of 20th century, rather timely in many respects."
Researching Mathematics Education in South Africa,"['Renuka Vithal', 'Jill Adler', 'Christine Keitel']",['Education'],"Reflecting on the theoretical and ideological work that has contributed to the growth of mathematics education research in South Africa, this study provides a historical analysis of forces that have changed and shaped mathematics curricula over the years. The themes researched and explored include radical pedagogy, progressive classroom practices, ethnomathematics, and South African mathematics education research within both its local and international contexts."
"The Social Relations of Physics, Mysticism, and Mathematics",['S. Restivo'],['Gardening'],"Sal Restivo's book is a major achievement in the sociology of science and mathematics. It is exciting to read and constitutes a creative, wide-ranging exploration of the connections between physics and mysticism, between the natural science and the humanities. Of particular interest is his attempt to show the emergence of abstraction and of formal disciplines in science by relating them to the structure of social interests in society. All told, this book challenges the separation of C.P. Snow's two cultures' and is an original attempt to overcome the chasms between the natural sciences, the humanities, and the social sciences. The implications of the book's content certainly go far beyond its title.' Prof. W. Heydebrand, New York University"

The content of the book is spread over 5 sections: The secondary-tertiary transition; University students' mathematical practices and mathematical inquiry; Research on teaching and curriculum design; University students’ mathematical inquiry and Mathematics for non-specialists."
Researching the Socio-Political Dimensions of Mathematics Education,"['Paola Valero', 'Robyn Zevenbergen']",['Education'],Mathematics education research as a discipline is situated at the confluence of an array of diffuse‚ seemingly incommensurable‚ and radically divergent discourses. Research claims that have grown out of mathematics education are wide-ranging and antagonistic rather than circumscribed by hidebound disciplinary frames. While there has never been a unified‚ totalising discipline of knowledge labelled ‘mathematics education research’‚ and while it has always been a contested terrain‚ it is fair to say that the master paradigm out of which this field has been generated has been that of cognitive psychology. Mainstream mathematics education knowledges refracting the master discourse of psychology —whereby cognition serves as the central privileged and defining concept— clearly delimits its possibilities for serving as a social tool of democratic transformation. The central point of departure of this new collection is that mathematics education research is insufficiently univocal to support the type of uncompromising interpretation that cognitive psychologists would bring to it. The hallmark contribution of this pathbreaking volume edited by Paola Valero and Robyn Zevenbergen is the paradigmatic shift the authors have effected in the field of mathematics education research‚ taking up a position at the faultline of socio-cultural analysis and critical pedagogy.
Research and Development in University Mathematics Education,"['Viviane Durand-Guerrier', 'Reinhard Hochmuth', 'Elena Nardi', 'Carl Winsløw']",['Education'],"In the last thirty years or so, the need to address the challenges of teaching and learning mathematics at university level has become increasingly appreciated by university mathematics teachers, and beyond, by educational institutions around the world. Indeed, mathematics is both a condition and an obstacle to success for students in many educational programmes vital to the 21st century knowledge society, for example in pure and applied mathematics, engineering, natural sciences, technology, economics, finance, management and so on. This breadth of impact of mathematics implies the urgency of developing research in university mathematics education, and of sharing results of this research widely. This book provides a bespoke opportunity for an international audience of researchers in didactics of mathematics, mathematicians and any teacher or researcher with an interest in this area to be informed about state-of-the-art developments and to heed future research agendas. This book emerged from the activities of the research project INDRUM (acronym for International Network for Didactic Research in University Mathematics), which aims to contribute to the development of research in didactics of mathematics at all levels of tertiary education, with a particular concern for the development of early-career researchers in the field and for dialogue with university mathematicians. The aim of the book is to provide a deep synthesis of the research field as it appears through two INDRUM conferences organised in 2016 and 2018. It is an original contribution which highlights key research perspectives, addresses seminal theoretical and methodological issues and reports substantial results concerning the teaching and learning of mathematics at university level, including the teaching and learning of specific topics in advanced mathematics across a wide range of university programmes."
International Perspectives on Teaching and Learning Mathematics with Virtual Manipulatives,['Patricia S. Moyer-Packenham'],['Education'],"This book explores terminology, frameworks, and research being conducted worldwide on virtual manipulatives. It brings together international authors who provide their perspectives on virtual manipulatives in research and teaching. By defining terminology, explaining conceptual and theoretical frameworks, and reporting research, the authors provide a comprehensive foundation on the study and use of virtual manipulatives for mathematics teaching and learning. This foundation provides a common way for researchers to communicate about virtual manipulatives and build on the major works that have been conducted on this topic. By discussing these big ideas, the book advances knowledge for future research on virtual manipulatives as these dynamic tools move from computer platforms to hand-held, touch-screen, and augmented platforms."
Mathematical Problem Solving,"['Peter Liljedahl', 'Manuel Santos-Trigo']",['Education'],"This book contributes to the field of mathematical problem solving by exploring current themes, trends and research perspectives. It does so by addressing five broad and related dimensions: problem solving heuristics, problem solving and technology, inquiry and problem posing in mathematics education, assessment of and through problem solving, and the problem solving environment. Mathematical problem solving has long been recognized as an important aspect of mathematics, teaching mathematics, and learning mathematics. It has influenced mathematics curricula around the world, with calls for the teaching of problem solving as well as the teaching of mathematics through problem solving. And as such, it has been of interest to mathematics education researchers for as long as the field has existed. Research in this area has generally aimed at understanding and relating the processes involved in solving problems to students’ development of mathematical knowledge and problem solving skills. The accumulated knowledge and field developments have included conceptual frameworks for characterizing learners’ success in problem solving activities, cognitive, metacognitive, social and affective analysis, curriculum proposals, and ways to promote problem solving approaches."
The Mathematical Sciences in 2025,"['National Research Council', 'Division on Engineering and Physical Sciences', 'Board on Mathematical Sciences and Their Applications', 'Committee on the Mathematical Sciences in 2025']",['Mathematics'],"The mathematical sciences are part of nearly all aspects of everyday life-the discipline has underpinned such beneficial modern capabilities as Internet search, medical imaging, computer animation, numerical weather predictions, and all types of digital communications. The Mathematical Sciences in 2025 examines the current state of the mathematical sciences and explores the changes needed for the discipline to be in a strong position and able to maximize its contribution to the nation in 2025. It finds the vitality of the discipline excellent and that it contributes in expanding ways to most areas of science and engineering, as well as to the nation as a whole, and recommends that training for future generations of mathematical scientists should be re-assessed in light of the increasingly cross-disciplinary nature of the mathematical sciences. In addition, because of the valuable interplay between ideas and people from all parts of the mathematical sciences, the report emphasizes that universities and the government need to continue to invest in the full spectrum of the mathematical sciences in order for the whole enterprise to continue to flourish long-term."
Perspectives on Adults Learning Mathematics,"['D. Coben', ""J. O'Donoghue"", 'Gail E. FitzSimons']",['Education'],"At a time when the importance of lifelong education is becoming recognised around the world, this is the first book to explore an important but hitherto neglected area: adult mathematics education. This book is about adults learning mathematics wherever and in whatever circumstances they do so. It brings together researchers in the field and aims to lay the foundations for study and further research and practice in this fast-developing area. It aims to situate research and practice in adults learning mathematics within the wider field of lifelong learning and lifelong education and to be accessible both to the specialist and to the general adult reader. The book features a comprehensive review of the field which sets the scene for sections on: Perspectives on Research on Adults Learning Mathematics; Adults, Mathematics, Culture, and Society; Adults, Mathematics, and Work; and Perspectives in Teaching Adults Mathematics. Topics covered include: mathematics and common sense; statistical literacy and numeracy; new theories on learning mathematics; mathematical competences for the workplace; ethnomathematics; and the training of tutors."
Analysis of Arithmetic for Mathematics Teaching,"['Gaea Leinhardt', 'Ralph Putnam', 'Rosemary A. Hattrup']",['Education'],"This volume emerges from a partnership between the American Federation of Teachers and the Learning Research and Development Center at the University of Pittsburgh. The partnership brought together researchers and expert teachers for intensive dialogue sessions focusing on what each community knows about effective mathematical learning and instruction. The chapters deal with the research on, and conceptual analysis of, specific arithmetic topics (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, decimals, and fractions) or with overarching themes that pervade the early curriculum and constitute the links with the more advanced topics of mathematics (intuition, number sense, and estimation). Serving as a link between the communities of cognitive researchers and mathematics educators, the book capitalizes on the recent research successes of cognitive science and reviews the literature of the math education community as well."

For the first time, it was combined with the annual meeting of the working group “Problem Solving” of the Society of Didactics of Mathematics. This book contains 20 peer reviewed articles of researchers from five European countries. The topics of the papers evolved around different areas of learning and problem solving. There are some theoretical papers on problem oriented mathematics instruction and specific aspects of problem solving and creativity as well as reports on detailed studies of problem solving processes of pupils and preservice teachers. Authors also present experiences with “real” problem solving instruction in different countries, considerations and teaching experiments on didactic concepts to foster pupils’ problem solving abilities, and they describe mathematically rich problem fields and their potentials for mathematical investigations in class. ProMath is a group of experienced and early career researchers in the field of mathematics education who are interested in investigating and fostering mathematical problem solving and problem oriented mathematics teaching."
MATHEMATICAL REALITY,['Linfan MAO'],N/A,"A thing is complex, and hybrid with other things sometimes. Then, what is the reality of a thing? The reality of a thing is its state of existed, exists, or will exist in the world, independent on the understanding of human beings, which implies that the reality holds on by human beings maybe local or gradual, not the reality of a thing. Hence, to hold on the reality of things is the main objective of science in the history of human development."

"ATTITUDES TOWARDS MATHEMATICS AND MATHEMATICAL ACHIEVEMENT IN SECONDARY SCHOOLS IN ENGLAND: EXPLORING THE ROLE OF SOCIAL CLASS, GENDER AND ETHNICITY",['Jeffery Quaye'],['Education'],"This book is essential reading in the sociology of education, social policy and mathematics education. It is for teachers, principals, superintendents, school leaders and policymakers. For too long, many children have not achieved their best potential in mathematics at both primary and secondary schools. Although scholarly interest in students' attitudes towards mathematics and achievement in mathematics has increased, there is scant research which explores the explanatory potential of Bourdieu's trilogy of habitus, cultural capital and social field in investigating students' attitudes towards mathematics. The content is based on a rich empirical study of 1106 students aged 14-16 and gives a detailed account drawing on both quantitative and qualitative data to show the intersection of social class, gender and ethnicity on students' aspiration, attitudes towards mathematics and mathematical achievement at GCSE in secondary schools in England."

It offers substantive detail regarding young students' understandings of mathematical ideas.
Mathematical Problem Solving and New Information Technologies,['Joao P. Ponte'],['Computers'],"A strong and fluent competency in mathematics is a necessary condition for scientific, technological and economic progress. However, it is widely recognized that problem solving, reasoning, and thinking processes are critical areas in which students' performance lags far behind what should be expected and desired. Mathematics is indeed an important subject, but is also important to be able to use it in extra-mathematical contexts. Thinking strictly in terms of mathematics or thinking in terms of its relations with the real world involve quite different processes and issues. This book includes the revised papers presented at the NATO ARW ""Information Technology and Mathematical Problem Solving Research"", held in April 1991, in Viana do Castelo, Portugal, which focused on the implications of computerized learning environments and cognitive psychology research for these mathematical activities. In recent years, several committees, professional associations, and distinguished individuals throughout the world have put forward proposals to renew mathematics curricula, all emphasizing the importance of problem solving. In order to be successful, these reforming intentions require a theory-driven research base. But mathematics problem solving may be considered a ""chaotic field"" in which progress has been quite slow."

Theories of Mathematics Education,"['Bharath Sriraman', 'Lyn English']",['Education'],"Advances in Mathematics Education is a new and innovative book series published by Springer that builds on the success and the rich history of ZDM—The Inter- tional Journal on Mathematics Education (formerly known as Zentralblatt für - daktik der Mathematik). One characteristic of ZDM since its inception in 1969 has been the publication of themed issues that aim to bring the state-of-the-art on c- tral sub-domains within mathematics education. The published issues include a rich variety of topics and contributions that continue to be of relevance today. The newly established monograph series aims to integrate, synthesize and extend papers from previously published themed issues of importance today, by orienting these issues towards the future state of the art. The main idea is to move the ?eld forward with a book series that looks to the future by building on the past by carefully choosing viable ideas that can fruitfully mutate and inspire the next generations. Taking ins- ration from Henri Poincaré (1854–1912), who said “To create consists precisely in not making useless combinations and in making those which are useful and which are only a small minority."

Tentang Langit,['Aristoteles'],['Juvenile Nonfiction'],"Tentang Langit adalah risalah kosmologis utama Aristoteles: ditulis pada 350 SM, berisi teori astronomi dan gagasannya tentang cara kerja dunia terestrial. Menurut Aristoteles, benda-benda langit adalah realitas yang paling sempurna, sebuah ""substansi"", yang gerakannya diatur oleh prinsip-prinsip selain dari empat elemen klasik (tanah, air, udara, api). Keempat elemen tersebut mudah rusak; tetapi materi yang membuat langit tidak dapat binasa. Oleh karena itu gerakan mereka abadi dan sempurna, dan gerakan sempurna adalah gerakan melingkar yang—tidak seperti gerakan naik dan turun di bumi—dapat bertahan selamanya dengan sendirinya. Dalam buku ini, Aristoteles mengusulkan model geosentris alam semesta yang di dalamnya Bumi berposisi sebagai pusat gerak alam semesta, dengan gerakan melingkar sempurna. Karya ini penting sebagai salah satu pilar penentu pandangan dunia Aristotelian, sebuah aliran filsafat yang mendominasi pemikiran intelektual selama hampir dua milenium. Demikian pula, karya ini dan karya-karya lain oleh Aristoteles adalah karya-karya penting yang dengannya banyak skolastisisme dikembangkan."
